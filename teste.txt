MAN presented its new commercial vehicles and engines during the reporting 
year, including its first ever van, the MAN TGE. MAN’s new future program, 
launched in 2015, is making a substantial contribution to the brand’s success. 

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
In 2016, MAN presented the new TGL, TGM, TGS and TGX series vehicles with optimized powertrains. The D26 
and D38 engines offer increased torque and an extra 20 PS of power output while also reducing fuel consump-
tion. The 471 kW (640 PS) top-of-the-range version of the new D38 engine, which was previously reserved for 
heavy-duty vehicles, is now available for almost all versions of the 
MAN TGX D38. It generates up to 3,000 Nm of 
torque even at low revs. With the world premiere of the 
MAN TGE, the long-established, Munich-based brand 
has entered the van market. From 2017, this will make 
MAN a comprehensive provider for all transport needs 
from 3 to 250 tonnes. The newly unveiled 
NEOPLAN Tourliner rounds off  MAN’s bus portfolio with an entry 
model for the premium coach segment. The Power Engineering Business Area commissioned a gas-fired power 
station in China and a diesel power plant in Africa during the reporting year. A comprehensive package of 
measures was initiated to safeguard the future viability of the business area. 
The economic environment remained challenging for 
MAN in the 2016 fiscal year. In South America,  
demand was down on the weak prior-year level. Meanwhile, the European commercial vehicle market continued 
to recover. Orders received by 
MAN were 2.3% down on 2015 at 105 thousand vehicles. Deliveries remained on a 
par with the previous year at 102 (102) thousand commercial vehicles, of which 10 (10) thousand were buses.  
MAN produced 102 (101) thousand commercial vehicles in 2016, of which 10 (10) thousand were buses.  
Incoming orders in the Power Engineering Business Area fell to €3.3 (3.4) billion as a result of the continued 
difficult situation in the shipping industry, economic difficulties in developing countries and emerging markets 
and the low price of oil. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
MAN Commercial Vehicles’ sales revenue in 2016 stood at €10.0 billion, up 0.5% on the previous year. Operating 
profit before special items rose to €230 (–4) million. The operating return on sales before special items was  
2.3 (0.0)%. Volume effects, improved margins in Europe and the future programs introduced had a positive effect. 
Restructuring measures in South America led to special items of €–0.1 billion; in the previous year, special 
items of €–0.2 billion were incurred for restructuring measures in Europe.  
Sales revenue in the Power Engineering segment amounted to €3.6 (3.8) billion. There was a volume- and 
margin-related decline in operating profit before special items to €194 (283) million. The operating return on 
sales before special items was 5.4 (7.5)%. Restructuring measures led to special items of €–0.2 billion.
