TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS",,,,,,,,,,
143," Letter to our  
Shareholders
This is the first annual report of the Volkswagen Group where I have the privilege of writing to you as Chairman of the 
Board of Management",,,,,,,,,,
144," I welcome this opportunity, although I would have preferred to be addressing you in more  
auspicious circumstances: as a result of the irregularities relating to diesel engines which contradict the very essence of 
what Volkswagen stands for, we find ourselves in the midst of what is probably the greatest challenge in the history of our 
Company",,,,,,,,,,
145," On behalf of the Volkswagen Group I would like to apologize to you, our shareholders, that the trust you placed 
in

 
Volkswagen
 
has
 
been
 
broken",,,,,,,,,,
146," 
We are doing everything we can to overcome this crisis: with effective technical solutions for our customers and trustful 
cooperation with all the responsible authorities in order to completely and transparently clarify what happened",,,,,,,,,,
147," We are 
gradually making progress",,,,,,,,,,
148," Looking to the future, we must above all learn from past mistakes and draw the right conse-
quences so that something like this can never happen at Volkswagen again",,,,,,,,,,
149," That is what is needed to rebuild trust and 
get our Group back on the right track",,,,,,,,,,
150," I realize that this course sometimes puts a great strain on patience – both yours 
and ours",,,,,,,,,,
151," But everyone at Volkswagen is working most diligently and with great commitment to rebuild the high  
esteem

 
this
 
Group
 
rightly
 
enjoyed
 
for
 
so
 
long",,,,,,,,,,
152,"
The present crisis has a very significant impact on the Company",,,,,,,,,,
153," This is reflected among other things by the financial 
key performance indicators for the last fiscal year",,,,,,,,,,
154," But these figures also contain another important message: our  
operating business continues to be in excellent shape, our portfolio of twelve strong brands, unique in our industry, is 
carrying us even through this difficult phase",,,,,,,,,,
155," We delivered almost 10 million vehicles to customers in 2015 and grew 
sales revenue by over five percent to €213",,,,,,,,,,
156,3 billion,,,,,,,,,,
157," The operating result, which ran at €12",,,,,,,,,,
158,"7 billion in the previous year, 
was €–4",,,,,,,,,,
159,1 billion,,,,,,,,,,
160, That is attributable to negative special items totaling €16,,,,,,,,,,
161,"9 billion; without these special items, the 
operating result would have slightly exceeded the prior-year level",,,,,,,,,,
162, At €16,,,,,,,,,,
163,"2 billion, the lion’s share of special items is  
accounted for by contingency reserves for the diesel issue, including ongoing technical and customer-related measures, 
repurchases and legal risks",,,,,,,,,,
164, The Volkswagen Group’s earnings before and after tax amounted to €–1,,,,,,,,,,
165,"3, respectively 
€–1",,,,,,,,,,
166,"4

 
billion
 
as
 a 
result
 
of
 
the
 
high
 
exceptional
 
charges",,,,,,,,,,
167,"
Without the special items we would once again have been able to talk about a successful year overall",,,,,,,,,,
168," In light of this  
and given the Group’s unchanged robust financial strength, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board 
will propose a dividend of €0",,,,,,,,,,
169,11 per ordinary share and €0,,,,,,,,,,
170,"17 per preferred share to the Annual General Meeting of 
Volkswagen

 
Aktiengesellschaft
 
despite
 
the
 
negative
 
consolidated
 
result
 
of
 
the
 
Volkswagen
 
Group",,,,,,,,,,

8TO OUR SHAREHOLDERSLetter to our Shareholders",,,,,,,,,,
174,The diesel issue has clearly overshadowed much in recent weeks,,,,,,,,,,
175," For me it is important that you know there is much 
more to Volkswagen than this crisis",,,,,,,,,,
176," Our Group has qualities that did not vanish overnight, qualities on which we can 
also build for the future: strong brands and great vehicles, outstanding technological expertise and innovative 
strength, our global presence, millions of loyal customers all over the world, and a skilled team that is totally committed 
to these customers",,,,,,,,,,
177, I have great respect for the achievements and dedication of our employees,,,,,,,,,,
178," We are – I am – very 
grateful for that",,,,,,,,,,
179,"  
The Volkswagen Group has the firm resolve and the strength to master the difficult situation we find ourselves in with its 
own resources",,,,,,,,,,
180," From the outset, I have believed it is important we use this crisis as an opportunity: an opportunity to 
realign the Group in an automotive world that is facing epoch-making change",,,,,,,,,,
181," Our mission is to come up with the right 
answers to the big issues of the future, namely e-mobility, urbanization and digitalization",,,,,,,,,,
182," To do that, the Volkswagen 
Group must become faster and more efficient, more flexible and courageous, more technically progressive and sustain-
able in all relevant aspects",,,,,,,,,,
183," That is why we are realigning our structures, our mindset and the way we approach things",,,,,,,,,,
184," 
More than that – we are also renewing our targets, or to put it another way: we are evolving the strategy which has served 
us so well over the past years in light of the challenges to be faced over the next ten years",,,,,,,,,,
185," The presentation of our “Strategy 
2025”

 
mid-year
 
will
 
be
 
an
 
important
  
milestone",,,,,,,,,,
186," 
As far as Volkswagen is concerned, 2016 will clearly be a year of transition, a year when we lay the foundations for the 
future",,,,,,,,,,
187," I am firmly convinced that, with time, we will be able to say: no matter how grave the crisis was, it also opened 
doors for us",,,,,,,,,,
188, Because it encouraged us to set the right priorities and speed up overdue change,,,,,,,,,,
189," And because we will 
succeed in making Volkswagen a better company with the measures we are now putting in place",,,,,,,,,,
190," A Group that boldly 
seizes the future, attains sustainable growth and opens up long-term perspectives: for its customers, employees and 
partners,

 
for
 
society
 
and,
 
not
 
least,
 
for
 
you,
 
our
 
shareholders",,,,,,,,,,
191," 
A letter of this kind usually ends by asking shareholders for their trust",,,,,,,,,,
192," Now more than ever, that trust must be earned",,,,,,,,,,
193," 
And we are working on that",,,,,,,,,,
194," Which is why, this year, I am asking above all for your continued loyalty to Volkswagen in 
spite

 
of
 
the
 
present
 
pressures,
 
and
 
hope
 
you
 
remain
 
at
 
our
 
side
 
as
 
we
 
make
 
the
 
journey
 
into
 
the
 future",,,,,,,,,,

AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Annual General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on May 5, 2015 elected PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as auditors for fiscal year 2015, in line with our proposal",,,,,,,,,,
402," The auditors audited the 
annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Volkswagen Group and the 
combined

report,
  
and
 issued 
unqualified
 
audit
 
reports
 
in

403," 
In addition, they analyzed the risk management and internal control systems, concluding that the Board of Manage-
ment had taken the measures required by section 91(2) of the AktG to ensure early detection of any risks endangering 
the continued existence of the Company",,,,,,,,,,
404," The Report by Volkswagen AG on Relationships with Affiliated Companies in 
Accordance with Section 312 of the AktG for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015 (dependent company

405,"report) submitted by the Board of Management was also audited by the auditors, who issued the following opinion: “In 
our opinion and in accordance with our statutory audit, we certify that the factual disclosures provided in the report are 
correct and that the Company’s consideration concerning legal transactions referred to in the report was not unduly 
high",,,,,,,,,,
406,"” 
The members of the Audit Committee and the members of the Supervisory Board were provided in each case with the 
documentation relating to the annual financial statements, including the dependent company report, and the audit 
reports prepared by the auditors in good time for their meetings on April 21, 2016 and April 22, 2016 respectively",,,,,,,,,,
407," The 
auditors reported extensively at both meetings on the material findings of their audit and were available to provide addi-
tional

 
information",,,,,,,,,,
408,"
Taking into consideration the audit reports and the discussion with the auditors and based on its own conclusions, the 
Audit Committee prepared the documents for the Supervisory Board’s examination of the consolidated financial state-
ments, the annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG, the combined management report and the dependent com-
pany report and reported on these at the Supervisory Board meeting on April 22, 2016",,,,,,,,,,
409," Following this, the Audit Com-
mittee recommended that the Supervisory Board approve the annual financial statements",,,,,,,,,,
410," We examined the documents 
in depth in the knowledge and on the basis of the report by the Audit Committee and the audit report as well as in talks 
and discussions with the auditors",,,,,,,,,,
411," We came to the conclusion that they are due and proper and that the assessment of the 
position of the Company and the Group presented by the Board of Management in the management report corresponds 
to the assessment by the Supervisory Board",,,,,,,,,,
412," We therefore concurred with the auditors’ findings and approved the annu-
al financial statements prepared by the Board of Management and the consolidated financial statements at our meeting 
on April 22, 2016, at which the auditors also took part in discussions on the agenda items relating to the financial state-
ments",,,,,,,,,,

414," Our examination of the dependent company report did not 
result in any objections to the concluding declaration by the Board of Management in the dependent company report",,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the proposal on the appropriation of net profit submitted by the Board of Management, taking into account 
in

the
 
interests
 
of
 
the
 
Company
 
and
 
its
 
shareholders,
 
and
 
endorsed
 
the
 
proposal",,,,,,,,,,
416,"
The events surrounding the emissions issue have affected us all very deeply",,,,,,,,,,
417," Volkswagen does not tolerate any breaches 
of the law or other irregularities",,,,,,,,,,
418," The misconduct uncovered in fiscal year 2015 runs contrary to all of the values that 
Volkswagen stands for",,,,,,,,,,
419, The trust of our customers and the public is and will remain our most important asset,,,,,,,,,,
420," We are 
sincerely sorry for betraying this trust",,,,,,,,,,
421, We will spare no effort in restoring full confidence,,,,,,,,,,
422," The Supervisory Board has 
already initiated extensive measures in order to comprehensively
 
address

 issue",,,,,,,,,,

covered in emissions tests on certain vehicles with Volkswagen 
Group diesel engines",,,,,,,,,,

closed engine management software installed in certain four-cyl-
inder diesel engines used in certain 2009 to 2015 model year vehi-

NOX emissions testing regulations in the United 
States of America in order to comply with certification require-

 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT
  


The Emissions Issue",,,,,,,,,,
4484,"Based on the facts currently known by the Group Internal  
Audit function, in the past there were process deficiencies on the 
technical side in addition to misconduct on the part of individuals",,,,,,,,,,
4485," 
This was true of the testing and certification processes for the  
engine control units, for example, which were unsuited to pre-
venting the use of the software in question",,,,,,,,,,
4486," The Group Internal 
Audit function proposed specific remedial measures to address 
the identified weaknesses, which focus on creating more clearly 
structured and systematic processes on the technical side",,,,,,,,,,
4487," For  
example, the processes and structures used for approving the  
software for engine control units are being reorganized with more 
clearly defined and

 
binding
 
powers
 
and
 
responsibilities",,,,,,,,,,
4488," 
We have already resolved to make comprehensive changes to 
testing practices on the technical side as a key response to the 
Group Internal Audit function’s findings",,,,,,,,,,
4489," Therefore, Volkswagen 
has decided that in the future emissions tests, in general, will be 
externally evaluated by independent third parties",,,,,,,,,,
4490," Real-world ran-
dom tests of vehicles’ emissions behavior on the road will also be 
introduced",,,,,,,,,,
4491," 
Furthermore, the internal control system has been optimized 
through a new set of regulations for the procedure in control unit 
software development, emission classification and escalation 
management",,,,,,,,,,
4492,"
While the Group Internal Audit function has already com- 
pleted its analysis of the Company’s processes, the work being 
done by Jones Day will continue well into 2016",,,,,,,,,,
4493," One reason for the 
different durations of the investigations is that the external inves-
tigators must screen very large volumes of data",,,,,,,,,,
4494," By the end of  
December, over 100 terabytes of data had been secured and more 
than 1,500 electronic data storage devices from some 380 employees 
had been collected",,,,,,,,,,
4495," Moreover, the external investigation is seek-
ing to establish legal responsibility for what has occurred",,,,,,,,,,
4496," This 
means that the findings not only need to be plausible and consist-
ent

 
with
 
the
 
evidence,
 
but
 
must
 
also
 
stand
 
up
 
in
 
court",,,,,,,,,,
4497," 
Employees from the affected departments have been dis-
missed as a further direct consequence of the findings to date 
from

 
the
 
internal
 
inquiries
 
and
 
external
 
investigations",,,,,,,,,,
4498,"
The information that has been viewed so far has helped trace 
the origin and development of the diesel issue to a large extent",,,,,,,,,,
4499," The 
starting point was the strategic decision to launch a large-scale 
promotion of diesel vehicles in the 
USA in 2005",,,,,,,,,,
4500," To this end, a new 
diesel powertrain unit featuring high performance and cost-effi-
cient production – the EA 189 type engine – was to be developed",,,,,,,,,,
4501,"
The US emissions limits for emissions of pollutants are strict",,,,,,,,,,
4502,"  
Under the strictest standard in the 
USA at the time, only 31 mg/km 
of 
NOX were allowed to be emitted, about six times less than under 
the Euro 5 standard applicable in Europe at that time",,,,,,,,,,
4503," When  designing state-of-the-art diesel engines, technicians and engi-
neers face the challenge that measures to reduce NOX categorically 
have a knock-on
 
effect
 
on
 
other
 
parameters
  
(e",,,,,,,,,,
4504,g,,,,,,,,,,
4505,"
 
CO2)",,,,,,,,,,
4506,"
In the ensuing period, in order to resolve this conflicting  
objective satisfactorily within the time frame and budget of the  
EA 189 project, according to the current state of knowledge, a 
group of persons – whose identity is still being determined – at 
levels below the Group’s Board of Management in the powertrain  
development division, decided to modify the engine management 
software",,,,,,,,,,
4507," With this software modification, emissions values were 
generated in bench testing that differed substantially from those 
under

 
real
 
driving
 
conditions",,,,,,,,,,
4508,"
As things stand, outside the group of persons mentioned above, 
the then and current Board of Management of Volkswagen AG 
had, at any rate, no knowledge of the use of unlawful engine man-
agement software at the time",,,,,,,,,,
4509," Even after the International Council 
on Clean Transportation (
ICCT) study was published in May 2014, 
the discrepancies were initially regarded – on the basis of the facts 
currently known regarding the members of the Board of Manage-
ment responsible at that time – as a technical problem that did not 
basically differ from other everyday technical problems at an  
automotive company",,,,,,,,,,
4510," In the exhaust measurements carried out  
inhouse at Volkswagen in the subsequent months, the test set-ups 
on which the 
ICCT study was based were repeated and the unusu-
ally high 
NOX emissions confirmed",,,,,,,,,,
4511," CARB was informed of this 
result, and at the same time the offer was made to recalibrate the 
type EA 189 diesel engines as part of a service measure that was 
already planned in the 
USA",,,,,,,,,,
4512," This measure was evaluated and 
adopted by the Ausschuss für Produktsicherheit (
APS – product 
safety committee), which includes, among others, employees 
from the technical development, quality assurance, sales,  
production, logistics, procurement and legal departments, as 
part of the existing processes within the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
4513," The 
APS thus plays a central role in the internal control system at  
Volkswagen AG",,,,,,,,,,
4514," There are currently no reliable findings to con-
firm that an unlawful software modification was reported by the 
APS as the cause of the discrepancies to the persons responsible 
for preparing the 2014 annual and consolidated financial state-
ments",,,,,,,,,,
4515," Instead, at the time that the annual and consolidated  
financial statements were being prepared, this group of people 
remained under the impression that the discrepancies could be 
eliminated with comparatively little effort as a part of a field 
measure",,,,,,,,,,
4516," Based on what is currently known, the actual back-
ground of the discrepancies only became clear gradually to the 
members of the Board of Management dealing with the matter",,,,,,,,,,
4517," It 
was only reliably recognized in the summer of 2015 that the 
cause of the discrepancies was a software modification, to be

mental law",,,,,,,,,,
4519," This culminated in the disclosure of the “defeat  
device” to the 
EPA/CARB on September 3, 2015",,,,,,,,,,
4520," According to the 
assessment at that time of the members of the Board of Manage-
ment dealing with the matter, the scope of the costs expected as 
a result by the Volkswagen Group (recall costs, retrofitting costs 
and financial penalties), was basically not dissimilar to that of 
previous cases in which other vehicle manufacturers were  
involved, and therefore appeared to be controllable overall with 
a view to the business activities of the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
4521," This 
appraisal by Volkswagen AG was based on the assessment of a law 
firm brought in in the 
USA for approval issues, according to which 
similar cases in the past were resolved amicably with the US  
authorities",,,,,,,,,,
4522," Publication of a “Notice of Violation” by the

Group structure",,,,,,,,,,
4590," The Volkswagen Group’s management will be 
more decentralized in future, with greater independence for

decisions and processes will become leaner, faster and more effi-
cient",,,,,,,,,,
4593," The Group Board of Management will focus on its core role:

synergies, control and strategy",,,,,,,,,,
4594," The fourth point involves a re- 
alignment of culture and management practices at Volkswagen",,,,,,,,,,
4595, Establishing a new way of thinking takes time,,,,,,,,,,

Goals and Strategies  
 
55  
The Volkswagen Group sent a strong signal with the launch of its 
Strategy 2018 in 2008",,,,,,,,,,
4609," The clear and ambitious goals triggered 
significant momentum within the Company, laying the foundation 
for the Group’s significant success in recent years",,,,,,,,,,
4610," In this context, 
and in light of the fundamental changes both in the automotive 
industry and within the Company itself, now is the time to realign 
the Volkswagen Group, both technologically and strategically",,,,,,,,,,
4611," The 
basis for this realignment is our Strategy 2018, in which we defined 
four goals that are intended to make Volkswagen the most 
successful, fascinating and sustainable automaker in the world: 
> Volkswagen intends to deploy intelligent innovations and tech-
nologies to become a world leader in customer satisfaction and 
quality",,,,,,,,,,
4612," We see high customer satisfaction as one of the key 
requirements for the Company’s long-term success",,,,,,,,,,
4613," 
> The goal is to generate unit sales of more than 10 million vehicles 
a year; in particular, Volkswagen intends to capture an above-
average share of growth in the major growth markets",,,,,,,,,,
4614,"  
> Volkswagen’s aim is a long-term return on sales before tax of at 
least 8% so as to ensure that the Group’s solid financial position 
is guaranteed and that it retains the ability to act even in difficult 
market periods",,,,,,,,,,
4615,"  
> Volkswagen aims to be the most attractive employer in the auto-
motive industry",,,,,,,,,,
4616," The aim is to have the best team in the sector: 
highly qualified, fit and above all motivated",,,,,,,,,,
4617," 
Our particular focus is on the environmentally friendly orientation 
and profitability of our vehicle projects so that the Volkswagen 
Group can achieve success even in more challenging conditions",,,,,,,,,,
4618," 
We are selectively expanding our range of vehicles to safeguard the 
strong position enjoyed by our individual brands and to system-
atically increase our competitive advantages",,,,,,,,,,
4619," 
Our activities are primarily designed to set new standards in the 
areas of vehicles, drivetrains and lightweight construction",,,,,,,,,,
4620," Our 
modular toolkit system, which we are enhancing on an ongoing basis, allows us to improve the Group’s production efficiency and 
flexibility, and thus also its profitability",,,,,,,,,,
4621,"  
In addition, we intend to continually expand our customer base 
by increasing satisfaction among our existing customers and 
acquiring new customers around the world, particularly in the 
growth markets",,,,,,,,,,
4622," In order to ensure this, we are increasingly 
adapting our products and services to the specific local require-
ments",,,,,,,,,,
4623," We shall continue the measures we are currently taking to 
improve our productivity and quality regardless of the economic 
situation and without any time limit",,,,,,,,,,
4624," These include our regional 
development teams and our cooperation with local suppliers, 
among other things",,,,,,,,,,
4625," We are also continuing to standardize pro-
cesses in both the direct and indirect areas and are reducing 
production throughput times",,,,,,,,,,
4626," Together with disciplined cost and 
investment management, these measures play a major role in 
ensuring that we reach our long-term profitability targets and 
safeguard solid long-term liquidity",,,,,,,,,,
4627,"  
We will only successfully meet the challenges of today and 
tomorrow if all employees – from vocational trainees through to the 
Board of Management – consistently deliver excellence",,,,,,,,,,
4628," Outstand-
ing performance, the success that comes from it and participation 
in its rewards are therefore at the heart of our human resources 
strategy",,,,,,,,,,
4629,"  
Satisfied customers and motivated employees, excellent quality 
products and services, sustainable profitability and ecological 
responsibility are the cornerstones of the Strategy 2018, and 
remain unchanged",,,,,,,,,,
4630," Additionally, the “Future Tracks” initiative has 
already laid the valuable groundwork for the realignment, enabling 
us to address the issues of the future such as e-mobility, the digital 
shift and new business models",,,,,,,,,,
4631," We are developing our Strategy 
2025 for the Volkswagen Group on this basis, and aim to present the 
results starting in mid-2016",,,,,,,,,,
4632," The initial phase focuses on three 
issues: digitalization, integrity and legal affairs, and sustainability",,,,,,,,,,
4633," 

 
 
Goals  and Strategies  

The Volkswagen Group aims to increase its unit sales and profitability for the long term",,,,,,,,,,
4634," This is why 
its Strategy 2018 – with which Volkswagen intends to become the most successful, fascinating and 
sustainable automobile manufacturer – has been anchored in the Company",,,,,,,,,,

Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Internal Management System and Key Performance Indicators  
56  The Volkswagen Group’s performance and success can be measured 
using both financial and nonfinancial key performance indicators",,,,,,,,,,
4638," 
The following starts by describing the internal management 
process, and then explains the Volkswagen Group’s core perfor-
mance indicators",,,,,,,,,,
4639,"  
 
INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
The starting point for the Volkswagen Group’s internal manage-
ment is the medium-term planning conducted once a year",,,,,,,,,,
4640," This 
generally covers a period of five years and forms the core of our 
operational planning",,,,,,,,,,
4641," It is used to formulate and check the require-
ments for realizing strategic projects designed to meet Group 
targets in both technical and economic terms – and particularly in 
relation to earnings and liquidity effects",,,,,,,,,,
4642," In addition, it is used to 
coordinate all business areas with respect to the strategic action 
areas concerned: functions/processes, products and markets",,,,,,,,,,
4643,"  
When planning the Company’s future, the individual planning 
components are determined on the basis of the timescale involved: 
> The long-term unit sales plan, which sets out market and 
segment growth and then derives the Volkswagen Group’s 
delivery volumes from them",,,,,,,,,,
4644," 
> The product program as the strategic, long-term factor deter-
mining corporate policy",,,,,,,,,,
4645," 
> Capacity and utilization planning for the individual locations",,,,,,,,,,
4646," 
 The coordinated results of the upstream planning processes are 
used as the basis for the medium-term financial planning: the 
Group’s financial planning, including the brands and business 
fields, comprises the income statement, cash flow and balance 
sheet planning, profitability and liquidity, as well as the upfront 
investments needed for alternative products and the imple-
mentation of strategic options",,,,,,,,,,
4647," 
The first year of the medium-term planning period is then fixed 
and a budget drawn up for the individual months",,,,,,,,,,
4648," This is planned in 
detail down to the level of the operating cost centers",,,,,,,,,,
4649," 
During the year, the budget is reviewed each month to establish 
the degree to which the targets have been met",,,,,,,,,,
4650," In the process, 
target/actual comparisons, prior-year comparisons, variance analy-
ses and, if necessary, action plans to ensure targets are met, are key 
instruments within the management system",,,,,,,,,,
4651," For the current fiscal 
year, detailed revolving monthly forecasts are prepared for the 
coming three months and the full year",,,,,,,,,,
4652," These forecasts take into 
account the current risks and opportunities",,,,,,,,,,
4653," The focus of intrayear 
internal management is therefore on adapting ongoing operations",,,,,,,,,,
4654," 
At the same time, the current forecast serves as a potential, ongoing 
corrective to the medium-term and budget planning that follows on 
from it",,,,,,,,,,

and Key Performance 
Indicators 
Based on the goals set out in our Strategy 2018, this chapter describes how the Volkswagen Group

Internal Management System and Key Performance Indicators  
 
57  CORE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
The Volkswagen Group’s internal management is based on seven 
core performance indicators, which are derived from the goals set 
out in our Strategy 2018:  
> Deliveries to customers 
> Sales revenue 
> Operating result 
> Operating return on sales 
> Capex/sales revenue in the Automotive Division 
> Net cash flow in the Automotive Division 
> Return on investment ( ROI) in the Automotive Division 
Deliveries to customers are defined as handovers of new vehicles to 
the end customer",,,,,,,,,,
4659," This figure shows the popularity of our products 
with customers and is the measure we use to determine our 
competitive position in our markets",,,,,,,,,,
4660," Increasing deliveries to 
customers is closely linked to our objectives of offering superior 
customer satisfaction and quality, as well as achieving unit sales of 
more than 10 million vehicles – including the Chinese joint 
ventures",,,,,,,,,,
4661," High customer satisfaction, combined with and based on 
the outstanding quality of our vehicles, is one of the most important 
preconditions for the Company’s long-term success",,,,,,,,,,
4662," Demand for 
our products is what drives our unit sales and production, and 
hence determines capacity utilization at our locations",,,,,,,,,,
4663," Only 
employees who are highly qualified, fit and above all motivated can 
meet the goals we have set ourselves and ensure long-term financial 
success",,,,,,,,,,
4664," 
Sales revenue, which does not include the figures for our 
equity-accounted Chinese joint ventures, reflects our market 
success in financial terms",,,,,,,,,,
4665," Following adjustment for our use of 
resources, the operating result reflects the Company’s actual 
business activity and documents economic output in our core 
business",,,,,,,,,,
4666," The operating return on sales is the ratio of the operating 
result to sales revenue",,,,,,,,,,
4667," The ratio of capex (investments in property, plant and equipment, 
investment property and intangible assets, excluding capitalized 
development costs) to sales revenue in the Automotive Division 
reflects both our innovative power and our competitiveness",,,,,,,,,,
4668," It 
compares our capital expenditure – largely for modernizing and 
expanding our product range and environmentally friendly drive-
trains, as well as for increasing capacity and improving production 
processes – to the Automotive Division’s sales revenue",,,,,,,,,,
4669," 
Net cash flow in the Automotive Division represents the excess 
funds from operating activities available for dividend payments, for 
example",,,,,,,,,,
4670," It is calculated as cash flows from operating activities less 
cash flows from investing activities attributable to operating 
activities",,,,,,,,,,
4671," 
We use the return on investment (
ROI) to calculate the return on 
invested capital for a particular period in the Automotive Division, 
including the Chinese joint ventures on a proportionate basis, by 
calculating the ratio of the operating result after tax to invested 
capital",,,,,,,,,,
4672," If the return on investment (
ROI) exceeds the market cost of 
capital, the value of the Company has increased",,,,,,,,,,
4673," This is how we 
measure the success of our brands, locations and vehicle projects",,,,,,,,,,
4674," 
You can find information and explanations on the sales figures 
and the Volkswagen Group’s financial key performance indicators 
on pages 94 to 99 and on pages 109 to 125, respectively",,,,,,,,,,
4675,"

financial key performance indicators in the areas of corporate 
social responsibility, research and development, procurement, 
production, sales and marketing, quality assurance, employees, 
information technology and environmental management can be

MATERIAL CHANGES IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS 
The control and profit and loss transfer agreement between 
MAN SE, as the controlled company, and Volkswagen Truck & 
Bus GmbH (formerly Truck & Bus GmbH), a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of Volkswagen AG, as the controlling company, came into 
force on its entry in the commercial register on July 16, 2013",,,,,,,,,,
4729," The 
conclusion of the control and profit and loss transfer agreement 
replaced the group based on the de facto exercise of management 
control by a “contractual group”, permitting considerably more 
efficient and less bureaucratic cooperation between the 
MAN 
Group and the rest of the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
4730," Noncontrolling 
interest shareholders of 
MAN SE have the right to tender  MAN 
ordinary and preferred shares in Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH 
during and two months after the conclusion of the award pro-
ceedings instituted in July 2013 to review the appropriateness of the 
cash settlement set out in the agreement in accordance with section 
305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) and 
the cash compensation in accordance with section 304 of the AktG",,,,,,,,,,

July 2015 that the settlement payable to the shareholders should be 
increased from €80",,,,,,,,,,
4732,89 to €90,,,,,,,,,,
4733,29 per share,,,,,,,,,,
4734," Both Volkswagen and a 
number of the noncontrolling interest shareholders have appealed 
to the Higher Regional Court in Munich",,,,,,,,,,

2015, Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH held 75",,,,,,,,,,
4736,"56% of the ordinary 
shares and 46",,,,,,,,,,
4737,"19% of the preferred shares of 
MAN SE",,,,,,,,,,
4738," 
On March 14, 2014, Volkswagen AG made a voluntary tender 
offer to Scania’s shareholders for all shares not previously held by  
Volkswagen either directly or indirectly",,,,,,,,,,
4739," Following completion of the 
offer, Volkswagen increased its interest in Scania’s share capital to 
99",,,,,,,,,,
4740,57% at the end of 2014,,,,,,,,,,
4741," A squeeze-out was initiated for the 
Scania shares not tendered in the course of the offer, and on 
 November 11, 2014 the court of arbitration ruled in the squeeze-
out proceedings that all Scania shares outstanding would be 
transferred to Volkswagen AG",,,,,,,,,,

terminate the cooperation agreement",,,,,,,,,,

exercised this right, ending the partnership",,,,,,,,,,

the agreements had to be interpreted in such a way that Volkswagen 
had to sell its equity investment in Suzuki on termination of the

OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD, 
BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS 
In view of the purpose of the Company, its size and the extent of its 
international activities, the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG 
strives to take the following criteria into account in its composition:  
> At least three members of the Supervisory Board should be 
persons who embody in particular the characteristic of inter-
nationality",,,,,,,,,,
4895,"  
> At least four shareholder representative members of the Super-
visory Board should be persons who do not represent potential 
conflicts of interest, particularly conflicts of interest that could 
arise through a position as a consultant or member of the govern-
ing bodies of customers, suppliers, lenders, or other third parties",,,,,,,,,,
4896," 
> In addition, at least four of the shareholder representatives must 
be persons who are independent as defined by article 5",,,,,,,,,,
4897,4,,,,,,,,,,
4898,"2 of the 
German Corporate Governance Code",,,,,,,,,,

> Furthermore, proposals for elections should not normally include 
persons who will have reached the age of 75 by the time the 
election takes place or who have been members of the Super-
visory Board for more than 20 years by the time the election takes 
place",,,,,,,,,,
4900,  The above criteria have been met,,,,,,,,,,
4901," The statutory gender quota of at 
least 30% will apply to new appointments to the Supervisory Board 
of Volkswagen AG from January 1, 2016, based on the Gesetz für die 
gleichberechtigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungs-
positionen in der Privatwirtschaft und im öffentlichen Dienst (Act 
on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership 
Positions in the Private and Public Sectors)",,,,,,,,,,
4902,"  
The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG has also set itself the 
longer-term goal of increasing the proportion of female members 
on the Board of Management to 30%",,,,,,,,,,
4903," The Supervisory Board did 
not identify any opportunity for increasing the proportion of female 
members on the Board of Management by the end of 2016 as of the 
date stipulated in the Act for determining a specific target; as a result, 
it resolved a target quota of zero for December 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,
4904," However, 
the appointment of Dr",,,,,,,,,,
4905," Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt in October 
2015 to take up the newly created Board of Management position 
for Integrity and Legal Affairs with effect from January 1, 2016 
means that a female member has been appointed to the Group’s 
Board of Management",,,,,,,,,,
4906,"  
Volkswagen AG has set the following target quotas to increase 
the proportion of women in management: the aim is for the pro-
portion of women in the first management level to amount to  
9",,,,,,,,,,

Commitment to compliance at the highest level 
This view is expressly shared by the Company’s management",,,,,,,,,,

Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, Matthias 
Müller, said at a Group-wide information event for management in 
November 2015 that “no business in the world justifies violating 
legal and ethical limits",,,,,,,,,,

and Compliance (
GRC) organization in the Volkswagen Group (see 
the Report on Risks and Opportunities starting on page 170)",,,,,,,,,,

former judge at the German Federal Constitutional Court, has been 
appointed to this position",,,,,,,,,,

Volkswagen adopts a preventive compliance approach and aims 
to create a corporate culture that is designed to prevent potential 
breaches before they occur by raising awareness and educating 
employees",,,,,,,,,,
4931,"  
Group Internal Audit and Group Security regularly perform the 
necessary investigative activities, systematically monitor compli-
ance and perform random checks regardless of any suspicion of 
infringements, as well as investigating specific suspected breaches",,,,,,,,,,
4932," Responses are implemented by the Human Resources and Group 
Legal departments",,,,,,,,,,
4933," These processes are closely interrelated, in line 
with the concept of a comprehensive compliance management 
system",,,,,,,,,,
4934," Nevertheless, we are aware that even the best compliance 
management system can never entirely prevent the criminal actions 
of individuals",,,,,,,,,,

Compliance Officers or compliance contact persons (staff who are 
responsible at the brands, Volkswagen Financial Services and 
Porsche Holding GmbH, Salzburg)",,,,,,,,,,

ance officers in the Group companies",,,,,,,,,,

pliance Board at senior management level and the core Compliance 
team, which bundles expertise in compliance issues",,,,,,,,,,

  Focal points in 2015 
Each year, detailed compliance risk assessments are carried out 
across the Group as part of the standard 
GRC process",,,,,,,,,,
4940," The results 
are factored into the risk analyses performed by the Volkswagen 
Group, the brands and the companies, and into the Compliance 
Program planning",,,,,,,,,,
4941,"  
We primarily continued to drive forward our work in China  
in 2015 and intensified our compliance activities at Volkswagen 
Group subsidiaries and second-tier subsidiaries",,,,,,,,,,
4942," We reacted to 
events surrounding the emissions issue by adopting measures and 
launching campaigns: the brisk response by the employees to a call 
to participate in a photo campaign under the motto “Together for 
Volkswagen, Together for Compliance” demonstrated their clear 
commitment to compliance",,,,,,,,,,
4943," In addition, we have strengthened the 
product-related internal compliance control system in cooperation 
with internal and external experts",,,,,,,,,,
4944," Cross-departmental projects on 
this issue were initiated in particular at Technical Development",,,,,,,,,,
4945," 
Detailed information about the investigations into the emissions 
issue can be found in the special chapter on pages 49 to 54 of this 
Annual Report",,,,,,,,,,
4946," 
Communicating compliance 
The GRC organization provided information on various compliance 
issues to the Group’s brands and companies over the year, using a 
wide range of traditional communication channels",,,,,,,,,,
4947," These include 
reports in various employee magazines produced by the brands, 
companies and locations",,,,,,,,,,

integrated into our operational processes",,,,,,,,,,
4952," For example, all new 
employment contracts entered into between Volkswagen AG on the 
one part and both management staff and employees covered by 
collective agreements on the other include a reference to the Code 
of Conduct and the obligation to comply with it",,,,,,,,,,

activity, or other irregularities, such as violations of human rights 
and ethical misconduct, in all major Group languages to two 
external lawyers appointed by the Group",,,,,,,,,,

providing information have had the option of communicating with 
the ombudsmen via an additional online channel; various breaches 
can be reported using a technically highly secure electronic mailbox",,,,,,,,,,

Naturally, the people providing the information need not fear being 
sanctioned by the Company for doing this",,,,,,,,,,

the ombudsmen passed on 79 reports by people – whose details 
remained confidential if requested – to Volkswagen AG’s Anti-Cor-
ruption Officer in 2015",,,,,,,,,,

Remuneration Report  
 
67 PRINCIPLES OF AND CHANGES TO BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 
REMUNERATION 
The full Supervisory Board resolves on the remuneration system 
and the total remuneration for each individual member of 
Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management on the basis of the Exec-
utive Committee’s recommendations",,,,,,,,,,
5024," The remuneration of current 
members of the Board of Management complies with the require-
ments of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) 
and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance 
Code",,,,,,,,,,
5025," In particular, the remuneration structure is focused on 
ensuring sustainable business growth in accordance with the 
Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung (VorstAG – 
German Act on the Appropriateness of Executive Board Remu-
neration) and section 87(1) of the AktG",,,,,,,,,,
5026," 
The remuneration system of the members of the Board of 
Management was approved by the 50th Annual General Meeting on 
April 22, 2010 by 99",,,,,,,,,,
5027,44% of the votes cast,,,,,,,,,,
5028," At the same time, the 
Volkswagen Group’s positive business performance made it 
necessary in 2013 to modify and realign Board of Management 
remuneration and the comparative parameters on which it is based",,,,,,,,,,
5029," 
The remuneration of the Board of Management was modified with 
the assistance of a remuneration consultant, whose independence 
has been assured by the Supervisory Board and by the Company",,,,,,,,,,
5030," 
The level of the Board of Management remuneration should be 
appropriate and attractive in the context of the Company’s national 
and international peer group",,,,,,,,,,
5031," Criteria include the tasks of the 
individual Board of Management member, their personal per-
formance, the economic situation, the performance of and outlook 
for the Company, as well as how customary the remuneration is 
when measured against its peer group and the remuneration 
structure that applies to other areas of Volkswagen",,,,,,,,,,
5032," In this context, 
comparative studies on remuneration are conducted on a regular 
basis",,,,,,,,,,
5033," 
COMPONENTS OF BOARD OF MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION 
The remuneration of the Board of Management comprises non-
performance-related and performance-related components",,,,,,,,,,
5034," The 
non-performance-related components of the package ensure firstly 
a basic level of remuneration enabling the individual members of the Board of Management to perform their duties in the interests of 
the Company and to fulfill their obligation to act with proper 
business prudence without needing to focus on merely short-term 
performance targets",,,,,,,,,,
5035," On the other hand, performance-related 
components, dependent among other criteria on the financial 
performance of the Company, serve to ensure the long-term impact 
of behavioral incentives",,,,,,,,,,
5036," 
Upper limits are in place for both the overall remuneration and 
the performance-related remuneration components",,,,,,,,,,
5037,"  Non-performance-related remuneration 
The non-performance-related remuneration comprises fixed 
remuneration and fringe benefits",,,,,,,,,,
5038," In addition to the basic level of 
remuneration, the fixed remuneration also includes differing levels 
of remuneration for appointments assumed at Group companies",,,,,,,,,,
5039," 
The fringe benefits result from the grant of noncash benefits and 
include in particular the use of operating assets such as company 
cars and the payment of insurance premiums",,,,,,,,,,
5040," Taxes due on these 
noncash benefits are mainly borne by Volkswagen AG",,,,,,,,,,
5041," As compen-
sation for the loss of benefits due to the change of employer Mr",,,,,,,,,,
5042," Diess 
received €5",,,,,,,,,,
5043,0 million and Mr,,,,,,,,,,
5044, Renschler received €11,,,,,,,,,,
5045,5 million,,,,,,,,,,
5046," 
The basic level of remuneration is reviewed regularly and 
adjusted if necessary",,,,,,,,,,
5047," 
Performance-related remuneration 
The performance-related/variable remuneration comprises a 
business performance bonus, which relates to business perfor-
mance in the reporting period and in the preceding year, and, since 
2010, a Long-Term Incentive (
LT I) plan, which is based on the 
reporting period and the previous three fiscal years",,,,,,,,,,
5048," Both com-
ponents of performance-related/variable remuneration are there-
fore calculated on a multiyear basis and reflect both positive and 
negative developments",,,,,,,,,,
5049," Members of the Board of Management can 
also be awarded bonuses that reflect their individual performance",,,,,,,,,,
5050," 
The amounts shown (including remuneration withheld) in the 
Board of Management table for 2015 in accordance with the 
German Commercial Code correspond to the amounts determined 
by the Supervisory Board for fiscal year 2015",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Remuneration Report  
68  The amounts shown in the Board of Management (benefits received) 
tables in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code 
correspond to the amounts paid out for the fiscal year in question",,,,,,,,,,
5055," 
The amounts shown in the Board of Management (benefits 
granted) tables in accordance with the German Corporate 
Governance Code are based on a mean probability scenario at the 
beginning of fiscal year 2015",,,,,,,,,,
5056," 
The Supervisory Board may cap the performance-related/ 
variable remuneration components in the event of extraordinary 
developments",,,,,,,,,,
5057," 
Bonus 
The bonus rewards the positive business development of the 
Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
5058," 
The business performance bonus is calculated on the basis of 
the average operating result, including the proportionate operating 
result in China, over a period of two years",,,,,,,,,,
5059," A calculation floor below 
which no bonus will be paid is in place",,,,,,,,,,
5060," This floor was set at  
€5",,,,,,,,,,
5061,0 billion,,,,,,,,,,
5062," In addition, a cap for extraordinary developments is 
explicitly provided for by limiting the maximum theoretical bonus 
which, subject to the individual performance-related bonus, is 
€6",,,,,,,,,,
5063,"75 million for the Chairman of the Board of Management and 
€2",,,,,,,,,,
5064,5 million for the other members of the Board of Management,,,,,,,,,,
5065," 
The system and the cap are regularly reviewed by the Supervisory 
Board to establish whether any adjustments are necessary",,,,,,,,,,
5066," 
Accordingly, the method resolved by the Supervisory Board in 
2013 for calculating the business performance bonus for members 
of the Board of Management was changed for fiscal year 2015 and 
led to the operating result, including the proportionate operating 
result in China, for fiscal year 2015 that was used to calculate the 
business performance bonus for fiscal year 2015 being reduced  
to €0",,,,,,,,,,
5067," 
In addition, the Supervisory Board may increase the theoretical 
business performance bonus, which is calculated on the basis of the 
average operating result, by up to 50% by applying individual 
adjustment factors that are not linked to the theoretical cap so as to 
reward members of the Board of Management for extraordinary 
individual performance (individual performance bonus)",,,,,,,,,,
5068," This may 
take into account extraordinary performance in the area of inte-
gration, or the successful implementation of special projects, for 
example",,,,,,,,,,
5069," 
Long-Term Incentive (LTI) 
The amount of the  LT I depends on the achievement of the targets 
laid down in the Strategy 2018",,,,,,,,,,
5070," The target areas are: 
> Leader in customer satisfaction, measured using the Customer 
Satisfaction Index, 
> Leading employer, measured using the Employee Index, 
> Unit sales growth, measured using the Growth Index, and 
> Increase in the return on sales, measured using the Return Index",,,,,,,,,,
5071," 
The Customer Satisfaction Index is calculated using indicators that 
quantify the overall satisfaction of our customers with the delivering  
 dealers, new vehicles and the service operations based on the 
previous workshop visit",,,,,,,,,,
5072," 
The Employee Index is determined using the “employment” 
and “productivity” indicators as well as the participation rate and 
results of employee surveys",,,,,,,,,,
5073,"  
The Growth Index is calculated using the “deliveries to cus-
tomers” and “market share” indicators",,,,,,,,,,
5074," 
The Return Index is derived from the return on sales and the 
dividend per ordinary share",,,,,,,,,,
5075," 
The indices on customer satisfaction, employees and unit sales 
are aggregated and the result is multiplied by the Return Index",,,,,,,,,,
5076," This 
method ensures that the  LT I is only paid out if the Group is also 
financially successful",,,,,,,,,,
5077, If the 1,,,,,,,,,,
5078,"5% threshold for the return on sales 
is not exceeded, the Return Index is zero",,,,,,,,,,
5079," This would mean that the 
overall index for the fiscal year concerned is also zero",,,,,,,,,,
5080," 
The maximum 
LT I amount is capped at €4",,,,,,,,,,
5081,"5 million for the 
Chairman of the Board of Management and €2",,,,,,,,,,
5082,"0 million for the 
other members of the Board of Management and is based on the 
four-year average of the overall indices, i",,,,,,,,,,
5083,e,,,,,,,,,,
5084," the reporting period 
and the three preceding years",,,,,,,,,,
5085," 
An agreement was reached with Mr",,,,,,,,,,
5086," Winterkorn to defer payment 
of 30% of his variable remuneration for fiscal year 2015 to 
December 31, 2016",,,,,,,,,,
5087,"  
In a statement dated April 22, 2016, Mr",,,,,,,,,,
5088," Pötsch waived a 
portion of his variable remuneration for fiscal year 2015 in the 
amount of €2",,,,,,,,,,
5089,3 million,,,,,,,,,,
5090," 
OTHER AGREEMENTS 
Members of the Board of Management with contracts entered into 
on or after January 1, 2010 are entitled to payment of their normal 
remuneration for six to twelve months in the event of illness",,,,,,,,,,
5091," 
Contracts entered into before that date grant remuneration for six 
months",,,,,,,,,,
5092," In the event of disability, they are entitled to the retirement 
pension",,,,,,,,,,
5093,"  
Surviving dependents receive a widow’s pension of 66 2/3% 
and orphans’ benefits of 20% of the former member of the Board of 
Management’s pension",,,,,,,,,,
5094," Contracts with members of the Board of 
Management whose first term of office begins after April 1, 2015, 
provide for an entitlement – in line with the principles of the works 
agreement that also applies to employees of Volkswagen AG covered 
by collective agreements – to a widow’s pension of 60%, an 
orphan’s benefit of 10% for half-orphans and an orphan’s benefit 
of 20% for full orphans, based in each case on the former member 
of the Board of Management’s pension",,,,,,,,,,
5095," 
Withholding of variable remuneration for 2015 
At its meeting on April 22, 2016, Volkswagen AG’s Supervisory 
Board accepted the offer made by the members of the Board of 
Management to withhold 30% of the variable remuneration 
described above for fiscal year 2015 for the Board of Management 
members active on the date of the resolution and to make its 
disposal subject to future share price performance",,,,,,,,,,
5096, ,,,,,,,,,,
5097,"   GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Remuneration Report  
 
69 This will be effected by first converting the amount withheld based 
on the average share price for the 30 trading days preceding 
April 22, 2016 (initial reference price) into virtual preferred shares 
of Volkswagen AG with a three-year holding period and, at the same 
time, defining a target reference price corresponding to 125% of 
the initial reference price",,,,,,,,,,
5098," During the holding period, the virtual 
preferred shares will be entitled to a dividend equivalent in the 
amount of the dividends paid on real preferred shares",,,,,,,,,,
5099," 
Following the expiry of the holding period, the average share 
price for the 30 trading days preceding the last day of the holding 
period, i",,,,,,,,,,
5100,e,,,,,,,,,,
5101," April 22, 2019, will be determined (closing reference 
price)",,,,,,,,,,
5102," The difference between the target reference price and the 
initial reference price will be deducted from the closing reference price and the dividends distributed on one real Volkswagen 
preferred share during the holding period (dividend equivalent) 
will be added to the closing reference price",,,,,,,,,,
5103," This ensures that – 
excluding any dividend equivalents accrued – the amount withheld 
is only paid out in full if the initial reference price of the preferred 
share has increased by at least 25%",,,,,,,,,,
5104," Otherwise, the amount is 
reduced accordingly down to €0",,,,,,,,,,
5105," The amount thus calculated will be 
disbursed to the members of the Board of Management",,,,,,,,,,
5106," The 
amount disbursed must not be more than twice the amount 
originally withheld",,,,,,,,,,
5107," Where members of the Board of Management 
retire from office before the expiry of the holding period, the 
disbursement amount will be calculated and paid out propor-
tionately based on the date of termination of employment",,,,,,,,,,

tanker segment benefited from positive market expectations and an 
increase in freight rates in 2015 compared with the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
5723," A 
factor contributing to improving the income situation of shipping 
companies in the past year was that the currently low freight rates 
were offset by favorable fuel prices",,,,,,,,,,

power plants was lower overall than in the previous year, while the

5734,"  The market for the construction of turbomachinery is mainly 
dominated by investment projects in oil and gas, the processing 
industry and power generation",,,,,,,,,,
5735," The persistently low oil price 
caused leading oil and gas companies to slash investment, leading 
to project postponements or even cancellations",,,,,,,,,,
5736," Even the pro-
cessing industry suffered from low investment volumes because of 
the slowdown in growth in emerging markets and existing over-
capacity in some industries, for example in the steel industry",,,,,,,,,,

Japanese yen exchange rate led to increased competition",,,,,,,,,,

the market volume for turbomachinery in 2015 was below the 
prior-year level",,,,,,,,,,

In Europe, business with financial services products was 
buoyed by the good overall performance in Germany and signs of 
recovery in Western and Central Europe",,,,,,,,,,
5745," These offset the negative 
effects from the declining unit sales volumes in Russia",,,,,,,,,,
5746," 
After-sales products such as maintenance and spare parts 
agreements as well as insurance agreements saw an encouraging 
rise in demand",,,,,,,,,,
5747," Sales of financial services were bolstered by higher

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Shares and Bonds  
101 EQUITY MARKETS Prices on the international equity markets experienced volatility in 
the reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
6140," The 
DAX rose moderately overall",,,,,,,,,,
6141," Capital 
market participants were unsettled in particular by weakened eco-
nomic growth in China",,,,,,,,,,
6142,"  
The announcement by the European Central Bank (
ECB) at the 
beginning of the first quarter of 2015 of its intention to buy sover-
eign bonds, together with falling oil prices, resulted in significant 
share price gains",,,,,,,,,,
6143," The election result in Greece caused only short-
term price falls",,,,,,,,,,
6144," Positive economic data from the eurozone, hopes of 
an agreement between the eurozone countries and the Greek 
government, and some easing of the situation in Ukraine led to 
share prices rising further in February",,,,,,,,,,
6145," Buoyed up by positive 
signals from the US labor market, good economic data from 
Germany and the 
ECB’s bond purchases, the markets rose further 
at the beginning of March",,,,,,,,,,
6146," Towards the end of the first quarter, 
share prices declined slightly as expectations of a more restrictive 
monetary policy from the US Federal Reserve, among other things, 
unsettled capital market participants",,,,,,,,,,
6147," 
In the second quarter of 2015, the deteriorating situation in 
Greece and concerns about its effect on the European economy 
were the main triggers for falling prices",,,,,,,,,,
6148," Healthy corporate results 
and expectations that the 
ECB would continue its bond-buying 
program and the US Federal Reserve its loose monetary policy 
brought about a temporary recovery in April, propelling the 
DAX to a 
new all-time high of 12,375 points",,,,,,,,,,
6149," The 
DAX moved sideways amid 
significant price swings as the second quarter progressed",,,,,,,,,,
6150," Investors’ 
hopes of a more expansionary monetary policy by the Chinese 
central bank and healthy labor market data from the 
USA supported  prices, while concerns over the situation in Greece led to uncer-
tainty",,,,,,,,,,
6151," Prices declined towards the end of the second quarter amid 
volatility brought about by increasing fears of sovereign insolvency 
in Greece and growing uncertainty about whether it would remain 
in the eurozone",,,,,,,,,,
6152,"  
In the third quarter, the agreement on a further rescue package 
for Greece and the resulting prevention of sovereign insolvency 
shored up prices in an environment dominated by considerable 
price falls on the Chinese stock markets",,,,,,,,,,
6153," As the third quarter pro-
gressed, uncertainty regarding the slower growth of the Chinese 
economy notably contributed to a decline in prices",,,,,,,,,,
6154," Prices stabilized 
temporarily towards the end of the third quarter, based on hopes of 
a key interest rate cut by China’s central bank and positive macro 
data from Europe, before declining once again at the end of 
September because of concerns regarding the slight slowdown in 
global economic growth",,,,,,,,,,
6155,"  
Following the price falls towards the end of the third quarter, 
hopes that the  ECB would expand its bond-buying program and the 
Chinese central bank would lower key interest rates initially drove 
prices higher in the last quarter",,,,,,,,,,
6156," In the last few trading weeks of 
2015, however, stock prices
 gave up some of their gains as negative 
economic data from China and the decline in the oil price unsettled 
capital market participants",,,,,,,,,,
6157," The US Federal Reserve’s interest rate 
hike towards the end of the fourth quarter met with a positive 
response on the European stock exchanges",,,,,,,,,,
6158," 
At the end of 2015, the 
DAX had reached 10,743 points, up 9",,,,,,,,,,
6159,"6% 
on the previous year’s figure",,,,,,,,,,
6160," The

MOVEMENTS IN THE PRICE OF VOLKSWAGEN’S SHARES 
On the whole, Volkswagen AG’s ordinary and preferred shares 
declined sharply in 2015, underperforming the overall market and 
the automotive sector",,,,,,,,,,
6166,"  
In the first quarter, both classes of shares clearly outperformed 
the upward trend on the equity markets",,,,,,,,,,
6167," The above-average 
increase at the beginning of 2015 was driven by several factors: 
firstly the strong results we presented when the Company’s annual 
financial statements for the fiscal year 2014 were published, but 
above all the positive conditions on the capital markets and the 
depreciation of the euro against other currencies, which is advan-
tageous for export industries",,,,,,,,,,
6168,"  
In the second quarter, Volkswagen shares gave up some of their 
gains made during the first three months",,,,,,,,,,
6169," With stock markets in 
decline, discussions about the composition of the Board of Manage-
ment and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG, as well as 
increasing concerns about slower growth in demand for passenger 
cars due to China’s weaker economy influenced market partici-
pants",,,,,,,,,,
6170," As the quarter progressed, both classes of shares were more 
volatile than the market as a whole, trailing market growth",,,,,,,,,,
6171," 
In the course of the third quarter, ordinary and preferred 
shares progressively continued their downward trend, thus lagging 
significantly behind the market trend",,,,,,,,,,
6172," Investors focusing on the 
automotive industry were unsettled by weaker economic growth in 
China, among other factors",,,,,,,,,,
6173," After the emergence of irregularities in the software used in certain diesel engines and the resulting 
public speculations concerning possible expected consequences, 
both classes of shares fell considerably in mid-September 2015",,,,,,,,,,
6174,"  
After reaching the lowest closing price for the year at the 
beginning of the fourth quarter, Volkswagen shares recovered 
temporarily from their sharp declines",,,,,,,,,,
6175," As a result of the news that, 
as part of the internal examination of all diesel engines, we also 
encountered evidence that irregularities in the determination of 
the CO
2 figures for vehicles’ type approvals in the EU28 countries 
could initially not be ruled out, the prices of both classes of shares 
trended lower again",,,,,,,,,,
6176," 
As the fourth quarter progressed, the information about 
technical solutions for our customers in the EU28 countries to 
rectify the irregularities in NO
x emissions, and the clarification of 
the CO
2 issue led to a rise in the share price amid significant 
fluctuations",,,,,,,,,,
6177," The prices of Volkswagen shares moved sideways 
towards the end of the fourth quarter",,,,,,,,,,

unsecured issues were euros, US dollars, sterling and Canadian 
dollars; the share of fixed-rate instruments was roughly twice as 
high as the share of variable-rate instruments",,,,,,,,,,
6464,"  
The need for financing was reduced as a result of the generally 
positive development of net liquidity in fiscal year 2015",,,,,,,,,,
6465," In addition 
to the operating business, the sale of the shares in Suzuki was a 
contributing factor",,,,,,,,,,

RATINGS 
In March 2015, rating agency Moody’s Investors Service raised its 
short-term and long-term ratings for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH by one notch 
each from P-2 to P-1 and from A3 to A2 respectively",,,,,,,,,,
6511," The primary 
reasons for this were the solid operating performance in 2014 and 
the expectation that this can be improved on over the next 12 to 18 
months due to the robust brand portfolio, the market position in 
Western Europe and China, and the continuing efforts to increase 
efficiency",,,,,,,,,,
6512,"  
In June 2015, Moody’s Investors Service raised the long-term 
rating of both Volkswagen Financial Services AG and Volkswagen 
Bank GmbH by two notches each to Aa3",,,,,,,,,,
6513," The reason for this was a 
change in the rating method",,,,,,,,,,
6514," 
As a result of the emissions issue, Moody’s Investors Service 
lowered its short-term and long-term ratings for Volkswagen AG in 
November 2015 by one notch each from P–1 to P–2 and from A2 to 
A3 respectively",,,,,,,,,,
6515," The long-term ratings for Volkswagen Financial 
Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH were downgraded from 
Aa3 to A1",,,,,,,,,,
6516," The rating agency lowered the outlook for the companies 
from stable to negative",,,,,,,,,,
6517,"  
In connection with the irregularities in the software used for 
certain diesel engines from the Volkswagen Group, in October 2015 
Standard & Poor’s initially downgraded the short-term and long-
term ratings for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Financial Services AG 
and Volkswagen Bank GmbH by one notch each, to A–2 and A– 
respectively",,,,,,,,,,
6518,"  
In a further step in December 2015, also as a result of the emis-
sions issue, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the long-term ratings 
for Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Financial Services AG from A– 
to 
BBB+",,,,,,,,,,
6519," The outlook for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Financial Ser-
vices AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH has been changed to negative",,,,,,,,,,
6520,"   VOLKSWAGEN IN SUSTAINABILITY RANKINGS AND INDICES  
Analysts and investors view corporate social responsibility  (CSR) 
and sustainability performance as leading indicators of forward-
looking corporate governance and therefore increasingly also base 
their recommendations and decisions on companies’ 
CSR and 
sustainability profiles",,,,,,,,,,
6521," Sustainability ratings are particularly well 
suited to evaluating a company’s environmental, social and eco-
nomic performance",,,,,,,,,,
6522," If a company achieves the highest scores in 
these ratings, this sends a clear signal to its stakeholders; it also 
raises its attractiveness as an employer and the motivation of its 
existing employees",,,,,,,,,,
6523,"  
In sustainability rankings and indices – such as the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices, 
CDP Carbon Disclosure Project, Sustain-
alytics, or oekom research – where we held top positions before the 
emissions issue, Volkswagen’s ratings have been downgraded or 
removed",,,,,,,,,,
6524,"  
In the Commercial Vehicles/Power Engineering Business Area, 
MAN retained its B– rating and prime status for its superior per-
formance in the area of corporate social responsibility awarded by 
the rating agency oekom research",,,,,,,,,,
6525,"  
In its annual review of its sustainability ranking, the Swiss 
rating agency Robeco
SAM selected MAN for listing in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index (
DJSI) World and the  DJSI Europe in the 
“Machinery and Electrical Equipment” sector",,,,,,,,,,

man company to be represented in both indices for the fourth

PRINCIPLES AND GOALS OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
Financial management at the Volkswagen Group covers liquidity 
management, currency, interest rate and commodity risk manage-
ment, as well as credit and country risk management",,,,,,,,,,
6731," It is performed 
centrally for all Group companies by Group Treasury, based on 
internal directives and risk parameters",,,,,,,,,,
6732," The MAN and Porsche 
Holding Salzburg subgroups are integrated into the main financial 
management functions, while Scania is integrated to a very limited 
extent",,,,,,,,,,
6733," Additionally, these subgroups have their own well-estab-
lished financial management structures",,,,,,,,,,
6734,"  
The goal of liquidity management is to ensure that the Volks-
wagen Group remains solvent at all times and at the same time to 
generate an adequate return from the investment of surplus funds",,,,,,,,,,
6735," 
We use cash pooling to optimize the use of existing liquidity between 
the significant companies in Europe",,,,,,,,,,
6736," To do this, the – positive or 
negative – balances accumulating on the cash pooling accounts are 
swept daily into a target account at Group Treasury and thus pooled",,,,,,,,,,
6737," 
Currency, interest rate and commodity risk management is 
designed to hedge the prices on which investment, production and 
sales plans are based using derivative financial instruments",,,,,,,,,,
6738," Credit 
  and country risk management aims to use diversification to avoid 
exposing the Volkswagen Group to the risk of loss or default",,,,,,,,,,
6739," To 
achieve this, internal limits are defined on the basis of various 
credit risks for the volume of business per counterparty when 
entering into financial transactions",,,,,,,,,,
6740," These primarily focus on the 
capital resources of potential counterparties, as well as the ratings 
awarded by independent agencies",,,,,,,,,,
6741," The relevant risk limits and the 
authorized financial instruments, hedging methods and hedging 
horizons are approved by the Executive Committee for Liquidity 
and Foreign Currency",,,,,,,,,,
6742,"

financial management, please refer to page 185 and to the notes to 
the 2015 consolidated financial statements on pages 278 to 286",,,,,,,,,,

123 RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI) AND VALUE CONTRIBUTION  
The Volkswagen Group’s financial target system centers on contin-
uously and sustainably increasing the value of the Company",,,,,,,,,,
7170," We 
have been using the return on investment (
ROI) and value con-
tribution*, a key performance indicator linked to the cost of capital, 
for a number of years in order to use resources in the Automotive 
Division efficiently and to measure the success of this",,,,,,,,,,
7171,"  
The concept of value-based management allows the success of 
the Automotive Division and individual business units to be evalu-
ated",,,,,,,,,,
7172," It also enables the earnings power of our products, product 
lines and projects – such as new plants – to be measured",,,,,,,,,,
7173," 
Components of value contribution 
Value contribution is calculated on the basis of the operating result 
after tax and the opportunity cost of invested capital",,,,,,,,,,
7174," The operating 
result shows the economic performance of the Automotive Division 
and is initially a pre-tax figure",,,,,,,,,,
7175," 
Using the various international income tax rates of the relevant 
companies, we assume an overall average tax rate of 30% when 
calculating the operating result after tax",,,,,,,,,,
7176," 
The cost of capital is multiplied by the invested capital to give 
the opportunity cost of capital",,,,,,,,,,
7177," Invested capital is calculated as total 
operating assets (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, 
lease assets, inventories and receivables) less non-interest-bearing 
liabilities (trade payables and payments on account received)",,,,,,,,,,
7178," 
As the concept of value-based management only comprises our 
operating activities, assets relating to investments in subsidiaries 
and associates and the investment of cash funds are not included 
when calculating invested capital",,,,,,,,,,
7179," Interest charged on these assets 
is reported in the financial result",,,,,,,,,,
7180," 
Determining the current cost of capital 
The cost of capital is the weighted average of the required rates of 
return on equity and debt",,,,,,,,,,
7181," The cost of equity is determined using the 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (
CAPM)",,,,,,,,,,
7182," 
This model uses the yield on long-term risk-free Bunds, 
increased by the risk premium attaching to investments in the 
equity market",,,,,,,,,,
7183," The risk premium comprises a general market risk 
and a specific business risk",,,,,,,,,,
7184,"  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
*  The value contribution corresponds to the Economic Value Added (EVA®)",,,,,,,,,,
7185," EVA® is a 
registered trademark of Stern Stewart & Co",,,,,,,,,,
7186," 
 The general risk premium of 6",,,,,,,,,,
7187,"5% reflects the general risk of a 
capital investment in the equity market and is oriented on the 
Morgan Stanley Capital International ( MSCI) World Index",,,,,,,,,,
7188,"  
The specific business risk – price fluctuations in Volkswagen 
preferred shares – has been modeled in comparison to the 
MSCI 
World Index when calculating the beta factor",,,,,,,,,,
7189," The 
MSCI World 
Index is a global capital market benchmark for investors",,,,,,,,,,
7190," 
The analysis period for the beta factor calculation spans five 
years with annual beta figures on a daily basis and an average 
subsequently being calculated",,,,,,,,,,

The operating result after tax of the Automotive Division, including 
the proportionate operating result of the Chinese joint ventures, 
was €–203 (11,734) million in fiscal year 2015",,,,,,,,,,
7223," The year-on-year 
decrease was primarily due to negative special items as a result of 
the diesel issue",,,,,,,,,,
7224," In addition, profit was negatively impacted by 
declining vehicle volumes, higher depreciation and amortization 
charges due to the high volume of capital expenditures, higher 
research and development costs, and market support measures 
linked to the emissions issue",,,,,,,,,,

ments in the mix and more favorable exchange rates had an 
offsetting effect",,,,,,,,,,

allocation are not taken into account as they cannot be influenced 
operationally by management",,,,,,,,,,
7227,"  
Invested capital rose to €84,289 (78,889) million, primarily due 
to increased investments in property, plant and equipment, invest-
ment property and intangible assets, excluding capitalized develop-
ment costs (capex), and higher capitalized development costs",,,,,,,,,,
7228,"  The return on investment ( ROI) is the return on invested capital for

(invested capital multiplied by cost of capital) was down on the 
prior-year level due to decreased cost of capital",,,,,,,,,,

125 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC POSITION  
The Board of Management of Volkswagen AG considers business 
development and the economic position to have been strained",,,,,,,,,,
7243," 
Especially the irregularities in the software used in certain diesel 
engines posed major challenges for the Company",,,,,,,,,,
7244," In addition, the 
increasingly difficult conditions in the Brazilian, Chinese and 
Russian vehicle markets led to a decline in deliveries to customers 
compared with the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
7245," Contrary to our original forecast, 
deliveries of 9",,,,,,,,,,
7246,9 million vehicles (–2,,,,,,,,,,
7247,"0%) failed to exceed the 2014 
level",,,,,,,,,,
7248," Group sales revenue increased year-on-year, as forecast, and 
was above the forecast range – due to exchange rate effects, among 
other factors",,,,,,,,,,
7249," In particular, the provisions recognized in 
connection with the diesel issue weighed on the Group’s operating 
result and operating return on sales; both figures were down 
significantly on the previous year and the forecast ranges",,,,,,,,,,
7250," 
Excluding special items, the Group’s operating result was on a level 
with 2014, at €12",,,,,,,,,,
7251,8 billion,,,,,,,,,,
7252," The operating return on sales before 
special items was in the expected range, at 6",,,,,,,,,,
7253,0%,,,,,,,,,,
7254,"  
Sales revenue of the business areas was also up on the respec-
tive prior-year figure",,,,,,,,,,
7255," While special items resulted in the operating 
result and the operating return on sales of the Passenger Cars 
Business Area falling short of the forecast ranges, the Commercial 
Vehicles/Power Engineering Business Area confirmed the forecast, despite special items from restructuring measures",,,,,,,,,,
7256," The Financial 
Services Division’s operating result exceeded the previous year’s 
figure",,,,,,,,,,
7257,"  
Although at 6",,,,,,,,,,
7258,"9% the ratio of capex to sales revenue in the Auto-
motive Division was higher than in 2014, it was within the expected 
range",,,,,,,,,,
7259," The Automotive Division’s net cash flow exceeded the prior 
year’s figure because of the sale of the shares in Suzuki",,,,,,,,,,
7260," In addition, 
the successful placement of dual-tranche hybrid notes strength-
ened our capital base",,,,,,,,,,
7261," The Automotive Division’s net liquidity was 
€6",,,,,,,,,,
7262,"9 billion higher at the end of the reporting period than at the end 
of December 2014",,,,,,,,,,
7263," The decline in the operating result attributable 
to special items led to a significant decrease in the Automotive Divi-
sion’s return on investment (ROI), which fell short of the minimum 
required rate of return on invested capital",,,,,,,,,,
7264," 
Volkswagen does not tolerate any infringements of rules or laws",,,,,,,,,,

ethical challenges in their daily work",,,,,,,,,,
7538," It embodies the Group values 
of customer focus, top performance, creating value, renewability, 
respect, responsibility and sustainability",,,,,,,,,,
7539," All employees are equally 
responsible for adhering to these principles",,,,,,,,,,
7540,"  
International conventions, regulations and internal rules are 
also key guidelines for our conduct",,,,,,,,,,
7541," Through the “Declaration on 
Social Rights and Industrial Relationships at Volkswagen” (Volks-
wagen Social Charter), the Charter on Labor Relations, the Charter 
on Temporary Work and the Charter on Vocational Education and 
Training, we also profess our commitment to fundamental human 
rights, labor standards and principles",,,,,,,,,,
7542,"  
Strategic stakeholder management 
We cannot be successful in the long term without communicating 
with our stakeholders and knowing their expectations",,,,,,,,,,
7543," As the 
complexity of the Volkswagen Group increases, so do the 
expectations of and our network of relationships with the various 
stakeholders",,,,,,,,,,
7544," Our communication with stakeholders therefore 
covers many aspects, ranging from expectation management to 
innovation momentum, to identifying opportunities and risks",,,,,,,,,,
7545," We 
  

 
are open to a constructive and equitable dialog where we learn from 
one another",,,,,,,,,,
7546," Our goal is to agree on a common solution, but at the 
very least each to gain a mutual understanding of the other’s initial 
situation and position",,,,,,,,,,
7547,"  
Our brands in particular hold intensive dialogs with their 
stakeholders",,,,,,,,,,
7548," We pool this communication at Group level in order 
to be able to discuss Group-wide issues in detail",,,,,,,,,,
7549," In this context, we 
are also involved in organizations that concentrate on issues related 
to sustainable development",,,,,,,,,,

and by the project teams of the brands and regions",,,,,,,,,,
7559," For the project 
teams we have specifically selected representatives of the relevant 
specialist areas",,,,,,,,,,
7560," This enables us to react quickly to the diverse 
requirements of stakeholders",,,,,,,,,,
7561," 
Our stakeholder management consists of a variety of instru-
ments: dialogs, workshops, symposiums, public debates, social 
media, questionnaires, evaluations and projects",,,,,,,,,,
7562," In order to sys-
tematically manage all these activities, we document them in an IT-
based stakeholder management system",,,,,,,,,,
7563,"  
In 2015, we used the results of the comprehensive stakeholder 
questionnaires from brands and companies to identify key issues",,,,,,,,,,
7564," 
In order to systematically prioritize the issues identified, we 
evaluate them using the latest international sustainability studies 
and benchmark them against the guidelines and conventions that 
Volkswagen is committed to",,,,,,,,,,
7565," Internal bodies that also involve all 
brands and regions discuss and evaluate the key issues",,,,,,,,,,
7566," These 
discussions center around three main criteria: 
> the expectations of stakeholders, 
> the significance for the Company and  
> the extent to which the Company can influence these issues",,,,,,,,,,
7567,"  
The results give us the Volkswagen Group’s key action areas for 
achieving our sustainability goal",,,,,,,,,,
7568,"  
 
CSR Projects 
The Volkswagen group initiates and manages a variety of  CSR 
projects around the world, which are based on the following key 
principles: 
> The projects are compatible with the Group’s principles while at 
the same time addressing a specific local or regional issue",,,,,,,,,,
7569," 
> They demonstrate the diversity in the Group and in the social 
environment in which they are implemented",,,,,,,,,,
7570," 
> They are the result of close stakeholder dialog with the local 
players involved in implementation",,,,,,,,,,
7571," 
> Project management is the responsibility of the local units 
working on the project",,,,,,,,,,
7572," 
The Volkswagen Group supports the arts and culture, education, 
science, health and sport in a large number of projects; other 
initiatives serve to develop regional structures and conserve nature",,,,,,,,,,
7573," 
These projects make 
CSR a learning platform for all brands and in 
all of the Company’s regions",,,,,,,,,,
7574," Examples include our cooperation 
with the German Red Cross (
DRK) and our efforts to help refugees",,,,,,,,,,
7575,"  
Humanity, public spirit and responsibility – these are the values 
on which the work of the German Red Cross is based, and we in the 
Volkswagen Group share these values",,,,,,,,,,
7576," We are promoting sound, 
balanced social development, in Germany and at our other 
international locations",,,,,,,,,,
7577," As part of a strategic partnership, the 
Volkswagen Group helps the German Red Cross to find even more people who are willing to volunteer their time",,,,,,,,,,
7578," This goal is central to 
the partnership, in conjunction with strengthening the Red Cross’s 
rescue service",,,,,,,,,,
7579," 
Under the motto “Helping Together”, we are joining in the 
collective task of receiving and integrating the refugees who come to 
Europe and Germany",,,,,,,,,,
7580," This is accomplished through a wide variety 
of projects, starting with immediate aid in the initial accom-
modation facilities to local integration and education projects, on to 
providing vehicles and non-monetary resources",,,,,,,,,,
7581," A newly created 
Internet platform serves as a volunteer database and a source of 
information to support active volunteer helpers",,,,,,,,,,
7582," This is because we 
are convinced that with their help, the Volkswagen Group, its 
brands, locations and employees can not only make a humanitarian 
contribution, but thereby also contribute to the cohesion of society",,,,,,,,,,
7583,"  
Our long-standing cooperation and consultancy agreement 
with the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union 
( NABU) expired on December 31, 2015",,,,,,,,,,
7584," Extension of the contract 
and further collaboration are suspended for the time being as a 
result of the diesel issue",,,,,,,,,,
7585," We would like to continue our strategic 
partnership with 
NABU and are working intensively on creating the 
conditions required for this",,,,,,,,,,
7586," 
“FUTURE TRACKS” 
The automotive industry is facing the greatest upheavals in its 
history",,,,,,,,,,
7587," Alternative drive systems, the digitization of the entire value 
chain and rapidly changing global customer expectations of 
mobility will shape the coming years",,,,,,,,,,
7588," In response, the Volkswagen 
Group has launched the “Future Tracks” program: we are devel-
oping solutions for the fundamental upheavals and challenges at 
Board of Management and senior executive level",,,,,,,,,,
7589," “Future Tracks” 
brings together all topics, activities and measures that we are 
deploying now and will be deploying in the coming years to prepare 
for the major issues of the future – across all brands and regions 
and throughout the entire Group",,,,,,,,,,
7590," 
From a technical viewpoint, our work focuses on drive tech-
nologies, digitization and the networking of products and 
production",,,,,,,,,,
7591," Added to this are new requirements for individual 
mobility and mobility-related services",,,,,,,,,,
7592," Our efforts aim to ensure 
that the Volkswagen Group takes a leading role in shaping and 
influencing the new world of mobility",,,,,,,,,,
7593," 
A solid commercial basis is essential to be able to tackle these 
challenges successfully",,,,,,,,,,
7594," For this reason, “Future Tracks” has been 
introduced not only as a forward-looking program – it also focuses 
on efficiency",,,,,,,,,,
7595," Our intention is to continue to grow profitably, 
ensuring that we are always in the position to invest in the future of 
the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 
The Volkswagen Group’s research and development activities in 
fiscal year 2015 concentrated on expanding our product portfolio 
and improving the functionality, quality, safety and environmental 
compatibility of our products",,,,,,,,,,
7600,"  
A central challenge for Volkswagen is to recognize new develop-
ments in society, politics, technology, the environment and the 
economy at an early stage",,,,,,,,,,
7601," These form an important basis for 
innovations and thus our business success",,,,,,,,,,
7602," The Volkswagen Group’s 
research constantly addresses the latest trends and has established 
research offices in the key global automotive markets – including in 
China, Japan and the United States",,,,,,,,,,
7603," They monitor technological 
areas relevant to the automotive industry, conduct cooperative 
projects with research institutions and local companies, thereby 
gaining enlightening new insights for the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,

Fuel and drivetrain strategy 
The Volkswagen Group invested €11",,,,,,,,,,
7605,"9 billion in research and 
development in fiscal year 2015",,,,,,,,,,
7606," The majority of this was spent on 
efficiency-increasing technologies",,,,,,,,,,
7607," After reviewing the CO
2 issue, 
the vehicles’ emissions figures of only a very limited number of 
engine-transmission variants have to be adjusted in the course of 
normal processes",,,,,,,,,,
7608," The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet 
in the EU (excluding Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average 
of 120",,,,,,,,,,
7609,"8 g CO
2/km* in the reporting period and thus complied with 
the 2015 European limit of 130 g CO
2/km",,,,,,,,,,
7610," The Lamborghini and 
Bentley brands each have an independent fleet for the purposes of 
the European CO
2 legislation and complied with their individual 
targets",,,,,,,,,,
7611," We currently offer a total of 608 model variants (engine-
transmission combinations) that emit less than 130 g CO
2/km",,,,,,,,,,
7612," For 
489 model variants, we are already below the threshold of 
120 g CO
2/km",,,,,,,,,,
7613," 145 model variants in fact remain below 100 g 
  CO 2/km",,,,,,,,,,
7614," 87 model variants are already below the European fleet 
target of 95 g CO
2/km valid from 2021 (see chart on page 135)",,,,,,,,,,
7615," 
The Volkswagen Group’s fuel and drivetrain strategy is paving 
the way for carbon-neutral and sustainable mobility",,,,,,,,,,
7616," Our goal is to 
increase drive system efficiency with each new model generation  
– irrespective of whether they are powered by combustion engines, 
hybrids, plug-in hybrids, pure electric drives, or potential future 
fuel cell drive systems",,,,,,,,,,
7617," All of our mobility concepts are tailored to 
our customers’ needs",,,,,,,,,,
7618," This will expand the portfolio of different 
drive systems and will lead to a future situation where there is 
greater coexistence of traditional drive systems and e-mobility side 
by side",,,,,,,,,,
7619," The current modular toolkits are designed so that the full 
range of drive systems can be deployed and flexibly mounted on 
product lines across our global locations",,,,,,,,,,
7620," In addition, there will be a 
Modular Electrification Toolkit in future that will form the 
backbone of upcoming electric vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
7621,"  
From today’s perspective, the combustion engine looks set to 
serve as the broad basis for drive technology in the coming years",,,,,,,,,,
7622," In 
the interest of using resources responsibly, it is therefore crucial to 
further optimize combustion engines",,,,,,,,,,
7623," Our new generations of 
petrol and diesel engines satisfy this requirement",,,,,,,,,,
7624," When it comes to 
vehicles with conventional drive systems, we have significantly 
reduced average fuel consumption",,,,,,,,,,
7625," We achieved this in particular 
with the aid of efficiency-increasing measures",,,,,,,,,,

customers can, for instance, experience this for themselves with the 
Caddy 
TGI, which was introduced in 2015 as the successor to the 
Caddy EcoFuel",,,,,,,,,,

predecessor, the smaller engine of the Caddy 
TGI clearly delivers 
significantly better acceleration and saves up to 1",,,,,,,,,,
7634,"7 kg of gas per 
100 km due to its turbocharger",,,,,,,,,,
7635," Natural gas is also an economic and 
clean drive system for heavy commercial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
7636," Liquefied natural 
gas (
LNG) must replace compressed natural gas ( CNG) for these 
engines to be used in long-distance trucks and buses, since this is 
the only way the required energy density and hence the desired 
range can be achieved",,,,,,,,,,
7637," Better infrastructure is needed for natural 
gas to be widely usable as a fuel",,,,,,,,,,
7638," For example, natural gas filling 
station networks have only been sufficiently developed in a few 
countries",,,,,,,,,,
7639," With the new P280, Scania introduced its fourth 
generation of commercial vehicles fueled by bioethanol and thus 
strengthened its position as the commercial vehicle manufacturer 
with the widest range of vehicles with renewable fuels",,,,,,,,,,
7640," The Euro-6 
trucks and buses from 
MAN can also be fueled by biodiesel and bio 
natural gas in several drive system variants",,,,,,,,,,
7641," 
We are expanding our traditional range of engines through 
drivetrain electrification",,,,,,,,,,
7642," The percentage of drivers traveling 
predominantly short distances is growing",,,,,,,,,,
7643," These include com-
muters and city residents, but also delivery vehicles in urban areas",,,,,,,,,,
7644," 
The population shift towards urban areas continues unabated, and 
by no means is this limited to just the burgeoning megacities of Asia 
and South America",,,,,,,,,,
7645," Purely electric vehicles like the e-up! and e-Golf  
  are emission-free and thus of particular interest to customers 
whose everyday driving covers short and medium distances",,,,,,,,,,
7646," Oppor-
tunities to charge privately – e",,,,,,,,,,
7647,g,,,,,,,,,,
7648," using a charging station installed 
at a customer’s location – must be supplemented by a good public 
recharging infrastructure in the medium to long term",,,,,,,,,,
7649," 
However, most customers also want to take their vehicles on 
longer trips",,,,,,,,,,
7650," Hybrid vehicles, in particular plug-in hybrids, combine 
highly efficient combustion engines with zero-emission electric 
motors",,,,,,,,,,
7651," Where this combination of drive concepts is concerned, 
Volkswagen sees an opportunity to offer electrified models for all 
mobility needs to customers of a wide range of vehicle classes, to 
build trust in the new technologies, and thus to help e-mobility gain 
acceptance",,,,,,,,,,
7652," We have been offering hybrid versions in a range of 
vehicle classes for several years",,,,,,,,,,
7653," In 2015, we introduced further 
plug-in hybrid models with the Passat  GTE and the Audi Q7 e-tron",,,,,,,,,,
7654,"  
The Volkswagen Group’s toolkit strategy realizes substantial 
synergies through using modules across model series and brands",,,,,,,,,,
7655," 
The vehicle architecture is designed so that all drive system types 
can be integrated flexibly and economically",,,,,,,,,,
7656," This applies in 
particular for models that are based on the same platform; for 
example, they can use a single plug-in hybrid system consisting of a 
highly-efficient turbo petrol engine, an electric motor, our compact 
six-speed dual clutch and a lithium-ion battery",,,,,,,,,,

expanded our expertise in electric traction with the help of 
additional technical specialists and experts",,,,,,,,,,
7676," 
Lifecycle engineering 
Innovations and new technologies for reducing fuel consumption 
alone are not enough to minimize the effect of vehicles on the 
environment",,,,,,,,,,
7677," This is because long before the wheels of a car turn 
  for the first time, raw materials need to be extracted and materials 
and components manufactured",,,,,,,,,,
7678,"  
This means that the assessment of new vehicles, components 
and materials begins before they are even produced: from the first 
idea and design sketches, through production and the subsequent 
usage phase, to recycling",,,,,,,,,,
7679," We therefore consider a vehicle’s impact on 
the environment throughout the entire product lifecycle",,,,,,,,,,
7680," To achieve 
this, we produce lifecycle analyses in accordance with  ISO stan-
dards 14040 and 14044",,,,,,,,,,
7681," By applying these we can determine where 
improvements have the greatest effect and develop innovations that 
target these points directly",,,,,,,,,,

We regularly inform our customers, shareholders and other 
interested groups about the success stories of our environmentally 
responsible vehicle development and lifecycle assessments",,,,,,,,,,

As we want to minimize our vehicles’ impact on the environ-
ment together with our suppliers, Volkswagen joined the 
CDP 
supply chain program in 2015",,,,,,,,,,

with some suppliers in order to find common innovative 
approaches to environmentally optimize certain components",,,,,,,,,,

In cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, we 
further developed our methods for calculating the so-called water 
footprint in 2015",,,,,,,,,,

136  Recycling 
Recycling makes a key contribution to reducing our products’ 
impact on the environment and conserving resources",,,,,,,,,,
7691," It is not just a 
matter of recycling vehicles at the end of their service life – on the 
contrary, even at the development stage for new vehicles, we pay 
attention to the recyclability of the required materials, the use of 
high-quality recycled material and the avoidance of pollutants",,,,,,,,,,
7692," At 
the same time, we factor in aspects of the use phase, for instance the 
treatment and disposal of service fluids or high-wear components",,,,,,,,,,
7693,"  
Volkswagen is also constantly working on developing and 
enhancing recycling methods, processes and technologies",,,,,,,,,,
7694," With 
VW-SiCon process – which has won several awards –we have 
developed a process that allows end-of-life vehicles to be 85% 
recycled and 95% recovered",,,,,,,,,,
7695," This complies with the regulatory 
requirements that have been in force in the EU since the beginning 
of the reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
7696," We are developing modern technologies for 
recycling components from electric vehicles with our partners as 
part of the LithoRec (lithium-ion battery recycling) and ElmoReL 
(electric vehicle recycling – key components in power electronics) 
research projects",,,,,,,,,,
7697,"  
Last but not least in this area, we have the Volkswagen Passen-
ger Cars brand’s Genuine Exchange Parts program",,,,,,,,,,
7698," Our industrial 
reconditioning produces high-quality exchange parts that conserve 
resources and offer the same quality, functionality and warranty but 
are on average 40% cheaper than the corresponding new parts",,,,,,,,,,

Intelligent mobility 
Mobility is one of the key conditions for economic growth and 
sustainable development",,,,,,,,,,
7700," It is thus necessary to meet the growing 
need for mobility despite the ever-decreasing availability of 
resources",,,,,,,,,,
7701, Mobility must be made more efficient and waste avoided,,,,,,,,,,
7702," 
In order to address this challenge, the “number one for intelligent 
mobility” target area has been included in the Group environ-
mental strategy (see 160)",,,,,,,,,,
7703," Volkswagen wants to set standards with 
integrated, intelligent mobility solutions and innovative transport 
systems",,,,,,,,,,
7704," To this end, we are opening up new fields of business and 
developing novel business models",,,,,,,,,,
7705," 
Given the variety of needs and local conditions for mobility, one 
possible solution alone will not be enough",,,,,,,,,,
7706," Volkswagen is therefore 
working on various approaches, from innovative vehicle concepts 
right through to research into innovative urban developments",,,,,,,,,,
7707," 
However, the solutions can only be fully effective if they are 
networked together and employed at the right time and in the right 
place",,,,,,,,,,
7708," They require the efficient interplay of people, infrastructure, 
technologies and means of transport",,,,,,,,,,
7709,"  
Since 2013, Volkswagen has been working with 14 other 
companies from different sectors in six cities across the world on 
the Sustainable Mobility Project 2",,,,,,,,,,
7710,"0 launched by the 
WBCSD",,,,,,,,,,

can be used to lock or unlock the vehicle, open and close all 
windows and start or stop the engine",,,,,,,,,,
7734," The digital key can also be 
transferred to other smartphones",,,,,,,,,,
7735," For example, this will make it 
possible for third parties to unload the car or service it without 
actually having the key in their hands – a new dimension for 
servicing and services",,,,,,,,,,
7736," Subsequently, the temporary access to the 
car will be deactivated again",,,,,,,,,,
7737," 
High performance telematics systems have already become 
common in Volkswagen Group’s heavy commercial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
7738," They 
make it possible to view vehicles’ efficiency transparently even in

Audi continues to intensively work on using lightweight 
construction to increase the dynamics of its models and at the same 
time decrease consumption",,,,,,,,,,
7747," The Audi Q7 body is made largely of 
aluminum",,,,,,,,,,
7748," Thanks to the Audi Space Frame construction, the 
vehicle body only weighs a little more than 200 kg",,,,,,,,,,
7749," In addition, large 
components made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (
CFRP) are 
integrated in the body of the Audi R8 Coupé",,,,,,,,,,
7750," In the RS models, 
various parts of the exterior and interior are made of 
CFRP",,,,,,,,,,

The next step in automotive lighting technology was displayed 
in a concept vehicle at the 
IAA in Frankfurt: the new matrix  OLED 
lights (
OLED: organic light-emitting diode)",,,,,,,,,,
7761," They enable a previ-
ously unknown degree of homogeneity of light and thus expand the 
creative leeway in vehicle design",,,,,,,,,,
7762," In contrast to point light sources 
such as 
LEDs, which are made of semiconductor crystals,  OLEDs 
are light emitting surfaces",,,,,,,,,,
7763," They will soon be able to generate turn 
signal and brake lights too",,,,,,,,,,

Driver assistance systems and automated driving 
In fiscal year 2015, we expanded the use of innovative driver 
assistance systems to additional vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
7768," Following their first use in 
the new Passat in 2014, the Trailer Assist, the Emergency Assist and 
the Traffic Jam Assist, for example, are also available in the latest 
models of Touran, Tiguan, Audi A4 and Audi Q7",,,,,,,,,,
7769," If the driver is not 
responding, the Emergency Assist makes an escalating sequence of 
attempts to wake the driver before bringing the car to an emergency 
stop",,,,,,,,,,
7770," Trailer Assist makes maneuvering a vehicle with a trailer 
easier by using a rear view camera to analyze the hitch articulation 
angle and to calculate the steering angle from this",,,,,,,,,,
7771," The Traffic Jam 
Assist uses Adaptive Cruise Control (
ACC) automated distance 
control and Lane Assist in order to enable partially automated 
driving in traffic jams",,,,,,,,,,
7772," At a speed of 0 to 65 km/h, the car follows the 
vehicle in front, controlling the acceleration and brakes within the 
limits of the system and independently keeps itself within the lane",,,,,,,,,,
7773," 
The gradual expansion of assistance systems paves the way for 
automated driving and increasingly takes the pressure off the driver",,,,,,,,,,

In 2014, Audi showed what the technology can already do in the 
field of fully automated driving: the Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept 
completed a lap of the Hockenheim Grand Prix track at racing 
speeds – without a driver",,,,,,,,,,
7783," On the Sonoma Raceway in California – 
one of the most challenging racetracks in the world – the latest 
generation of the Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept exceeded the 
previous top performance yet again in the year under review, 
making faster lap times than the racing drivers",,,,,,,,,,
7784," Further successes 
included a 550 mile piloted trip with an Audi A7 piloted driving 
concept on the highway from Stanford in Silicon Valley to Las Vegas, 
and a piloted drive through the heavy city traffic of Shanghai",,,,,,,,,,
7785," Audi 
will offer piloted driving for the first time in the next generation of 
the Audi A8",,,,,,,,,,

MAN and Scania 
are already working on intelligent systems that go beyond cruise 
control and Lane Assist",,,,,,,,,,
7788," As in the passenger cars area, Traffic Jam 
Assist will use automation to drive the truck through a traffic jam at 
a speed of up to 50 km/h, thus relieving the driver of monotonous 
tasks such as starting up the vehicle and braking",,,,,,,,,,
7789,"  
A further variant of the automated and networked approach is 
driving in a convoy, also referred to as platooning",,,,,,,,,,
7790," The first vehicle 
of the platoon chooses the lane and sets the pace; the following 
vehicles each drive in the slipstream of the vehicle in front and, 
thanks to the reduced wind resistance, can reduce their fuel con-
sumption and correspondingly the CO
2 emissions",,,,,,,,,,
7791," While platooning, 
all of the vehicles are connected to each other via a wireless LAN 
network and constantly exchange data such as 
GPS position, engine 
speed, speed, steering angle and the positions of the brake and 
accelerator pedals",,,,,,,,,,
7792," If the driver in front accelerates, the other 
drivers do too",,,,,,,,,,
7793," If the front vehicle brakes, the vehicles behind brake 
too",,,,,,,,,,
7794," Platooning ensures a consistent flow of traffic for the 
commercial vehicles involved",,,,,,,,,,

Emergency brake assist has been a mandatory equipment 
requirement for new registrations for most types of commercial 
vehicles since November 2015",,,,,,,,,,

MAN introduced the newest generation of emergency brake 
assistance with sensor fusion – the interaction of radar sensor and 
front camera – and the emergency brake signal",,,,,,,,,,

ations arising as a result require a high degree of flexibility from 
manufacturers",,,,,,,,,,
7900,"  
Global demand for commercial vehicles is expected to rise in 
the next few years",,,,,,,,,,
7901," At the same time, the requirements placed on 
commercial vehicle manufacturers keep increasing",,,,,,,,,,
7902," Emissions 
laws, safety regulations, and tax and toll models require a high 
degree of innovation and lead to technically highly developed and 
complex products",,,,,,,,,,
7903," Furthermore, commercial vehicle manufactur-
ers are increasingly evolving from pure vehicle suppliers into pro-
viders

The key performance parameters for manufacturers are the 
enhancement of alternative drive systems and fuels and customer-

7906,"handed more than 160,000 networked trucks over to customers",,,,,,,,,,
7907," 
Subject to the operator’s consent, the vehicles transmit informa-
tion about their position and their operating status such as fuel 
consumption and driving behavior at short intervals",,,,,,,,,,
7908," This infor-
mation provides additional efficiency and safety for our customers 
and enables the manufacturers to expand their business model 
and thus achieve greater independence from economic cycles",,,,,,,,,,
7909," We 
will tackle these challenges with individual solutions based on 
common

 platforms",,,,,,,,,,
7910," 
Increasingly strict emissions regulations, the customer’s de-
sire to save fuel and the interest in alternative drive systems are 
becoming an increasing focus",,,,,,,,,,
7911," For example, natural gas is used as 
an economical and clean drive system for city buses from 
MAN and 
Scania",,,,,,,,,,
7912," To be able to use natural gas engines for long-distance 
trucks and buses, however, 
LNG (liquefied natural gas) is required 
instead of 
CNG (compressed natural gas) because this is the only 
way to achieve the necessary energy density and thus the desired 
range",,,,,,,,,,
7913," Better infrastructure is needed for natural gas to be widely 
used as a fuel",,,,,,,,,,
7914," For instance, fuel station networks have only been 
sufficiently developed in a few countries",,,,,,,,,,
7915," Hybrid vehicles offer 
savings of up to 20% of the fuel in distribution transport",,,,,,,,,,
7916," Consid-
erable potential is also becoming apparent in long-distance trans-
port,

 
where
 
savings
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
8%
 
are
 
possible",,,,,,,,,,
7917," 
A fully electric drivetrain is currently not practical due to the 
still high weight of the battery and the associated decrease in the 
payload in long-distance transport; in distribution transport we 
are currently testing the e-Caddy in the light commercial vehicles 
segment – the e-load up! is already available",,,,,,,,,,
7918," Trials are also being 
run for mid-sized trucks",,,,,,,,,,
7919," Hybrid solutions make sense in city bus-
es due to the stop-and-go traffic",,,,,,,,,,
7920," 
MAN, for example, introduced 
the full hybrid bus Lion’s City Hybrid back in 2010",,,,,,,,,,
7921," Both 
MAN and 
Scania are currently developing zero-emissions fully electric city 
buses",,,,,,,,,,
7922,"  
The Volkswagen Group’s commercial vehicles brands are not 
only working on increasing efficiency and environmental compat-
ibility, but are also intensively developing new driver assistance systems to improve safety",,,,,,,,,,
7923," Existing systems such as the emergency 
braking system and the lane assist system are being continuously 
improved",,,,,,,,,,
7924," Further opportunities for safe driving arise from con-
nectivity,
 
for
 
example
 
in
 
the
 
field
 
of
 
car-to-car
 
communication",,,,,,,,,,
7925,"
Cross-brand management of the commercial vehicles busi-
ness field is part of the organizational structure at Volkswagen 
Truck
 & Bus GmbH",,,,,,,,,,
7926," A matrix structure guarantees that our strong 
brands continue to be able to act independently and optimally 
serve their respective customer groups",,,,,,,,,,
7927," At the same time, it ensures 
that economies of scale and synergies are achieved through coop-
eration

 
in
 
purchasing,
 
production
 
and
 development",,,,,,,,,,
7928,"  
The strategic objective is clear: Volkswagen Truck
 & Bus is 
aiming to become a Global Champion",,,,,,,,,,
7929," For us, however, it is not the 
sales volume that has priority, but profitability, practical innova-
tions and the expansion of our global presence",,,,,,,,,,
7930," The customer is 
always

 
at
 
the
 
heart
 
of
 
all
 
activities",,,,,,,,,,

In order to achieve these objectives, the brands will work  
to
gether on new business models and massively advance digitali-
zation in the commercial vehicles business",,,,,,,,,,
7932," In addition, a platform 
strategy is planned for mid-sized and heavy commercial vehicles 
in the future",,,,,,,,,,
7933," Common platforms for gearboxes, axles, selected 
cab components and driver assistance systems for trucks and bus-
es are currently in development",,,,,,,,,,
7934," In the long-term, the focus is on 
the overall powertrain as a truck’s most important cost driver",,,,,,,,,,
7935," In 
view of the long product lifecycles, it will be ten to fifteen years be-
fore the potential arising from this is fully exploited",,,,,,,,,,
7936," The common 
components will be the platform for creating brand-specific solu-
tions, although the brands will remain easy to differentiate for the 
customer",,,,,,,,,,
7937," By combining activities within Volkswagen Truck
 & Bus, 
we estimate long-term additional synergy potential of at least €650 
million

 
on
 
average",,,,,,,,,,
7938," 
There will also be synergies within light commercial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,

142  PROCUREMENT In 2015 the focus of procurement was essentially on safeguarding 
the provision of our needs, safeguarding vehicle start-ups and 
opening up new procurement markets for the best possible 
implementation of the procurement strategy in a targeted way and 
implementing our “Volkswagen 
FAST” initiative",,,,,,,,,,
7942,"  
 
Procurement strategy 
We are working systematically to further optimize the Volkswagen 
procurement organization and build on our abilities and strengths 
together with our suppliers",,,,,,,,,,
7943," Our objective is to have the most com-
petitive and highest performing procurement organization",,,,,,,,,,
7944," This is 
underpinned by the four strategic procurement targets derived 
from the Group strategy’s corporate goals and the global trends of 
our procurement markets: firstly, to actively shape technical and 
environmental innovation processes and thus to provide market-
centric top quality and innovations at competitive conditions; 
secondly, to meet all cost targets in order to ensure the profitability 
of our products over their entire lifecycle; thirdly, to safeguard the 
global procurement volume through the permanent availability and 
consistently high quality of procured components and guarantee a 
stable and efficient movement of goods; fourthly, to further 
increase the attractiveness of the business area of procurement and 
the satisfaction of our employees by creating optimal working con-
ditions",,,,,,,,,,
7945," 
Organizational structures were created in the brands to 
establish defined processes and new methods",,,,,,,,,,
7946," There are specific 
work packages and contacts at all management levels",,,,,,,,,,
7947," We regularly 
report and review the implementation status of the measures 
agreed",,,,,,,,,,
7948," For example, we ensure that the changes initiated contrib-
ute to reaching and permanently establishing our goals",,,,,,,,,,
7949," 
Volkswagen FAST – Future Automotive Supply Tracks 
FAST is the central initiative of Group procurement for developing 
the Volkswagen Group and its supply network in a future proof way 
within the framework of Future Tracks",,,,,,,,,,
7950," The goal of 
FAST is to 
successfully implement the key topics of innovation and globali-
zation through involving suppliers earlier and more intensively",,,,,,,,,,
7951," We 
will work even more closely and quickly with our most important 
partners in the 
FAST initiative",,,,,,,,,,
7952," In addition, some processes in the 
field of innovation and globalization that are available to all sup-
pliers will be revised as part of the program",,,,,,,,,,
7953," After the start of the 
program at the beginning of 2015, the suppliers who had an 
excellent record in their field of expertise were selected in a 
systematic and standardized qualification process",,,,,,,,,,
7954," Global strategies 
and technological focuses are coordinated even more closely with 
these partners, with the common goal of making impressive  
 technologies available to our customers even faster and imple-
menting worldwide vehicle projects more effectively and efficiently",,,,,,,,,,
7955,"  
We continuously review these strategic partnerships and 
change who is included among our  FAST suppliers as required",,,,,,,,,,
7956," For 
example, suppliers not previously selected continue to have the 
opportunity to qualify for the initiative",,,,,,,,,,
7957,"  
Procurement’s process optimization program 
Since the end of 2015, almost all the Group’s brands and com-
panies have been working within procurement with uniform and 
fully digital processes",,,,,,,,,,
7958," In 2014, we began including external 
partners in our digital networks",,,,,,,,,,
7959," They can access our systems at any 
time to receive the necessary and updated information",,,,,,,,,,
7960," The goal is 
to connect a global standardized digital network of all procure-
ment’s work processes with suppliers within the next four to five 
years",,,,,,,,,,
7961," In order to optimize and completely digitalize points of 
contact in the work with our suppliers, the “Supplier Interaction 
Management” program was created",,,,,,,,,,
7962,"  
 
Supply situation for procured components and raw materials 
Because component standardization within the Volkswagen Group 
is increasing, the importance of global safeguarding of procured 
component capacities increased further in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
7963," Procurement’s 
demand capacity management was again able to successfully 
manage all critical incidents and supply bottlenecks, for example 
brought about by production problems, fires, or natural disasters, 
through close, digitally supported cooperation with the suppliers in 
the year under review",,,,,,,,,,
7964," We are driving forward digital networking, 
which has already reached a high level, with the latest technologies",,,,,,,,,,
7965," 
As a consequence of the economic slowdown in China, the 
global economy lost some of its momentum in the reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
7966," 
In 2015, the commodity markets showed high sensitivity to political 
uncertainties",,,,,,,,,,
7967," This contributed to the prices for many raw and input 
materials, such as crude oil, steel and rare earths, moving sideways 
or downwards",,,,,,,,,,
7968," 
The reporting period was dominated by political tensions, 
particularly in Russia and Ukraine, and by the depreciation of the 
euro",,,,,,,,,,
7969," As a consequence, we were only able to benefit to a limited 
extent from the downward movement of commodities traded in 
dollars",,,,,,,,,,
7970," Thanks to the use of procurement strategies individually 
adjusted to the commodity markets, it was possible to minimize 
risks arising from volatile commodity prices",,,,,,,,,,
7971,"  
Digitalization of supply 
The Group Business Platform as the central interface between the 
Volkswagen Group and its partners forms the basis for the digital 
network of the future",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement 
143 access the business areas’ systems and process knowledge centrally 
via the Group Business Platform",,,,,,,,,,
7974," Every supplier, at the same time as 
employees in procurement, has the same view of the current supply 
situation regarding its parts",,,,,,,,,,
7975," This is the basis for the global coor-
dinated work for safeguarding supply in a dynamic network",,,,,,,,,,
7976," This 
network is thus able to react to every external influence in every part 
of the world at the same time",,,,,,,,,,
7977,"  
Procured component management and supplier management 
assure quality within the supply process 
Procured component management, as the technical area of pro-
curement, employs tool and process experts who safeguard new 
vehicle start-ups and aggregate projects worldwide in terms of both 
prevention and response",,,,,,,,,,
7978," In addition, the experts safeguard series 
production",,,,,,,,,,
7979," In line with the Group-wide growth strategy, procured 
component management is focusing in particular on knowledge 
transfer at the start of global projects",,,,,,,,,,
7980," Procured component manage-
ment is globally networked",,,,,,,,,,
7981," This means that synergy effects can be 
achieved in both production and process optimization at suppliers",,,,,,,,,,
7982," 
In the “Quality in Growth” program, procurement focuses on safe-
guarding start-ups and on managing the subcontractor structure",,,,,,,,,,
7983," 
The ever-growing requirements placed on suppliers to be ready 
for the start of production will lead to a stronger focus in particular 
on the suppliers’ industrialization processes as part of a continuous 
further development of the organization",,,,,,,,,,
7984,"  
In order to safeguard our vehicle start-ups, further perfor-
mance tests across all business areas are carried out at suppliers at 
various milestones of the product development process in addition 
to “two-days production”",,,,,,,,,,
7985," As a result, risks for vehicle start-ups can 
be recognized even earlier in terms of production and quality and 
appropriate countermeasures can be initiated",,,,,,,,,,
7986," 
In some production plants, start-up experts are additionally 
employed to further strengthen the local project organization and 
implement projects even more efficiently",,,,,,,,,,
7987,"  
Developing new procurement markets 
Procurement is organized globally and with its presence in 39 
locations across 23 countries ensures that the production facilities 
are sustainably supplied with production materials in the required 
quality and quantity at competitive conditions",,,,,,,,,,
7988," Access to relevant 
and inexpensive procurement markets is thus also guaranteed 
against a background of increasing globalization",,,,,,,,,,
7989," 
Establishing local supply streams is a core element of our 
growth strategy",,,,,,,,,,
7990," Low logistics costs, purchase prices in line with the 
market, import duties levied and independence from fluctuating 
exchange rates all strengthen competitiveness",,,,,,,,,,
7991," At the same time, 
people in the regions benefit",,,,,,,,,,
7992," We create skilled jobs and contribute 
to economic development by attracting supplier businesses to the 
area around our production locations",,,,,,,,,,
7993," In Pune in India, for example, 69 new supplier businesses were 
founded and thus around 13,500 direct and indirect jobs created",,,,,,,,,,
7994," 
Thanks to the sustainable development of partners at the Kaluga 
site, the plant there can now draw on more than 60 local suppliers 
for the models produced",,,,,,,,,,
7995," 
In addition to established sources of supply, the number of 
qualified suppliers and also suppliers able to export in the growth 
regions is increasing",,,,,,,,,,
7996," Experience working with local suppliers will 
be carried over into new projects via the regional procurement 
organization",,,,,,,,,,
7997," What is more, specially focused and cross-business-
area project teams work in the emerging and inexpensive 
procurement markets on gradually increasing the export share of 
qualified local suppliers",,,,,,,,,,
7998," We are thus increasing the size of our 
global supplier base and exploiting the relevant cost advantages",,,,,,,,,,
7999,"  
Thanks to these approaches, procurement is able to marshal a 
reliable supplier base for new locations quickly and efficiently",,,,,,,,,,
8000,"  Sustainability in supplier relationships 
In 2015, we continuously worked on the “sustainability in supplier 
relationships” concept across all brands and regions",,,,,,,,,,
8001," The focus 
here was on expanding our third-party audit program for suppliers",,,,,,,,,,
8002," 
We audited a total of 26 suppliers in the reporting period with our 
external partners",,,,,,,,,,
8003," 
After a walk-through of the results, action plans were developed 
jointly with suppliers where necessary, implementation of and 
compliance with which has been checked",,,,,,,,,,
8004," Environmental and 
working conditions could thus be improved with the suppliers 
concerned and risks minimized",,,,,,,,,,
8005," 
In addition, in the reporting period we trained both our own 
employees and our suppliers on the topic of “sustainability in sup-
plier relationships”",,,,,,,,,,
8006," Over 1,900 new employees received training 
and had their awareness of the issue raised in training sessions",,,,,,,,,,
8007,"  
In addition, as of December 31, 2015, over 19,500 of our 
suppliers have completed an e-learning module on sustainability on 
our Group Business Platform",,,,,,,,,,
8008," This program is supplemented by 
classroom training, which in 2015 also took place in some cases in 
cooperation with other automotive manufacturers in India and 
South Africa",,,,,,,,,,
8009," Our business partners provide us with information on 
their sustainability status",,,,,,,,,,
8010," In addition to the already established 
questionnaire on the Group Business Platform, which had been 
completed by over 18,000 of our suppliers as of December 31, 2015, 
we began to introduce a new, more comprehensive questionnaire 
in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8011," We make this questionnaire, which was developed jointly 
with other automotive manufacturers, available to our suppliers on 
an external online platform",,,,,,,,,,

144  Our actions are guided by the “Volkswagen requirements for 
sustainability in relations with business partners (Code of Conduct 
for Business Partners)”",,,,,,,,,,
8014," If we discover that individual suppliers may 
not be complying with these requirements, a Group office initiates 
improvement measures in dialog with the supplier in question",,,,,,,,,,
8015," The 
aim is to implement these improvements as part of a dialog in the 
spirit of partnership",,,,,,,,,,
8016," For example, the “sustainability in supplier

In order to achieve the objectives set, we defined a total of 13 
challenges and continuously worked on these",,,,,,,,,,
8077," The challenges 
represent the key action areas in Production, such as the imple-
mentation of the modular toolkit strategy and the expansion of the 
global production network, and are backed up with concrete 
actions",,,,,,,,,,
8078," Responsibility for their implementation has been assigned 
to Board of Management and executive management sponsorships 
as well as project teams from all brands and regions",,,,,,,,,,
8079," In order to 
identify a possible need for expansion or adaptation to meet these 
challenges at an early stage, key future trends and their impact were 
discussed",,,,,,,,,,
8080, The results are incorporated into the strategy work,,,,,,,,,,

an increasingly important role, with 31 locations",,,,,,,,,,
8085," The number of  
  production sites in North America (four) and South America (nine) 
remained unchanged in the reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
8086," The Group operates 
four locations in Africa",,,,,,,,,,
8087," 
In Europe, a new plant for the Volkswagen Commercial Vehi-
cles brand in Wrzesnia, Poland, has been under construction since 
the end of 2014, in addition to the existing plant in Poznan",,,,,,,,,,

are new or successor product start-ups, while the other 34 start-ups 
were attributable to derivatives and product upgrades",,,,,,,,,,
8109," 
A significant event for the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand 
was the start of production of the Touran replacement in Wolfsburg, 
which was launched in September",,,,,,,,,,
8110," In April and May, there was a 
generation change for two models at once at Volkswagen Commer-
cial Vehicles at the Hanover and Poznan locations with the start-up 
of the T6 and the new Caddy",,,,,,,,,,
8111," Production of the new A4 family began 
at Audi in May, initially with the saloon in Ingolstadt",,,,,,,,,,
8112," This was 
followed by the A4 Avant in August and the start of production of the 
saloon in Neckarsulm in October",,,,,,,,,,
8113," Production of the 
ŠKODA brand’s 
new Superb began in Kvasiny in March and production of the 
Combi began in June",,,,,,,,,,
8114," In November, Bentley launched the Bentayga, 
thus adding an 
SUV to its product range",,,,,,,,,,
8115," The SEAT brand’s whole 
Ibiza family received a product upgrade, as did the Porsche 911",,,,,,,,,,
8116," 
In addition to the numerous new production start-ups, the 
range of models with alternative drive systems was expanded 
through the addition of the natural gas-driven Caddy and the plug-
in hybrid versions of the Q7 and Passat",,,,,,,,,,
8117," Furthermore, production of 
the current models’ replacement products was started at the 
assembly locations in Malaysia, India and Russia",,,,,,,,,,
8118," 
At the engine and transmission plants, there was a large 
number of start-ups of new and more efficient powertrains in 2015, 
which also contributed to the expansion of local production  facilities",,,,,,,,,,
8119," For example, a new engine plant was opened in Kaluga, 
Russia, in summer 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8120," The plant, which has an annual capacity 
of 150,000 units, manufactures the 1",,,,,,,,,,
8121,"6 liter EA 211 engine, which 
has been adapted to the market, for local supply of the Russian 
vehicle plants in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod",,,,,,,,,,
8122," Volkswagen is thus 
expanding its industrial presence in Russia and fulfilling legal 
requirements for local value added",,,,,,,,,,
8123," In São Carlos, Brazil, 
production of three- and four-cylinder  TSI engines in the EA 211 
series was started at the engine plant at this site",,,,,,,,,,
8124," In the medium to 
long term, they will replace the previous generation produced there",,,,,,,,,,
8125," 
In addition, the new W12 petrol engine for use in the new Bentley 
Bentayga has been produced at the Crewe location in the United 
Kingdom since the end of 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8126," 
The Volkswagen Group celebrated some important production 
anniversaries in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8127," In South Africa, production of the one 
millionth Polo was celebrated at the beginning of the year",,,,,,,,,,
8128," At the 
end of April, the Taubaté location in Brazil celebrated the one 
hundred thousandth up!",,,,,,,,,,
8129," The five millionth vehicle on the Group-
wide 
MQB platform rolled off the production line in October",,,,,,,,,,
8130," The 
number of these vehicles has thus doubled within a year",,,,,,,,,,
8131," At the 
same time, 
ŠKODA produced the brand’s 13 millionth vehicle 
worldwide since joining the Group and the Kassel location 
celebrated production of the one millionth DQ500 dual-clutch 
transmission",,,,,,,,,,
8132," In addition, there was a milestone in November, as 
the two millionth Caddy rolled off the production line in Poznan",,,,,,,,,,
8133," 
A production anniversary was also celebrated in China in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8134," 
The number of vehicles produced in China (
SVW and FAW-VW) 
exceeded the 25 million mark in November",,,,,,,,,,

Sustainable Value Enhancement 
147 Flexibility in production 
The modular toolkits allow us to design our production sites to be 
flexible",,,,,,,,,,
8137," They generate synergy effects that enable us to reduce 
capital expenditure and make better use of existing capacities",,,,,,,,,,
8138," With 
these toolkits we have created the conditions for using the pro-
duction sites for several brands at the same time, and are imple-
menting these systematically in terms of plant capacity utilization",,,,,,,,,,
8139," 
For example, the 
ŠKODA Kvasiny location in the Czech Republic will 
also produce a vehicle for the 
SEAT brand starting in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
8140," Of the 
40 passenger car locations, 19 are now already multibrand locations",,,,,,,,,,
8141," 
Another concept for volume flexibility is the “turntable”",,,,,,,,,,
8142," This is 
used, among other things, to compensate for fluctuations in demand 
or in segment shifts",,,,,,,,,,
8143," One such “turntable” is formed by Volks-
wagen’s sites in Emden (Passat), Zwickau (Passat and Golf) and 
Wolfsburg (Golf)",,,,,,,,,,
8144,"  
As the complexity of products increases, a factory must work at 
optimal capacity so as to continue manufacturing high-quality pro-
ducts that give customers maximum benefits at competitive prices",,,,,,,,,,
8145," 
This is all made possible by the standardization of production 
processes and operating equipment at an early stage",,,,,,,,,,
8146," The basis for 
this is consistent construction and design principles that are 
defined in the form of product standards",,,,,,,,,,
8147," “Concept consistency” 
ensures that common design principles, joining techniques and 
joining sequences, but also installation and connection concepts, 
are applied in the brands’ development and production areas",,,,,,,,,,
8148," The 
principle of concept consistency is a fundamental component of the 
creation of efficient logistics and manufacturing processes",,,,,,,,,,
8149," 
 
The Group’s production system 
To help us become the world’s most powerful and most fascinating 
automotive production platform, we optimize and standardize our 
production processes",,,,,,,,,,
8150," The Group’s value-driven, synchronous 
production system provides us with the necessary methodologies 
and instruments for this",,,,,,,,,,
8151," Our goal is to establish the Group pro-
duction system throughout the world at all brand and regional 
locations so as to achieve sustainable and continuous improvement",,,,,,,,,,
8152," 
We have already made substantial progress towards this",,,,,,,,,,
8153," In the 
future, we will increase the attention we give to further strength-
ening the Group’s production system and increasing its presence",,,,,,,,,,
8154," 
As a first step in this direction we are measuring the extent to which 
the methodologies and instruments are being implemented at the 
locations",,,,,,,,,,
8155," The target/actual comparisons are used to identify fields 
of action",,,,,,,,,,
8156," These are then defined in a project plan and worked 
through in a structured manner in the second step",,,,,,,,,,
8157," As a synchro-
nous company, we are including all business areas so as to system-
atically optimize processes",,,,,,,,,,
8158," 
We are creating and managing a global production and logistics 
network in the area of material and vehicle logistics, from the 
  supplier to the assembly line and from the factory to the dealer and 
the customer",,,,,,,,,,
8159," Logistics services are planned across all brands from 
a single source, managed and, when required, purchased via the 
“procurement of logistics services”",,,,,,,,,,
8160," It is important to us to adhere to 
stable and uniform processes worldwide",,,,,,,,,,
8161," 
The Volkswagen Group’s automotive logistics are managed 
across all brands, locations and models",,,,,,,,,,
8162," Enduring efficiency is a 
prerequisite for our competitiveness",,,,,,,,,,
8163," We meet challenges of the 
Industry 4",,,,,,,,,,
8164,"0 with holistic optimizations, pioneering innovations, 
flexible supply streams and structures and an agile team",,,,,,,,,,
8165,"  
Our brands, regions and plants are together designing the 
logistics of tomorrow in a digital automotive world and using new 
technologies",,,,,,,,,,
8166," The massive rise in the availability of information is 
making processes from the supplier to the production plant to the 
customer more and more transparent",,,,,,,,,,
8167," We use animated planning 
tools for designing factories and supply streams and have already 
implemented the tracking of loaded trucks by  GPS",,,,,,,,,,
8168," Our production 
plants work in an automated and digitalized manner with driverless 
transport systems in logistics",,,,,,,,,,
8169,"  
In all this, the traditional logistics objective still applies: infor-
mation, material and vehicles are to be in the right place at the right 
time in the right quality and quantity – at the optimum cost",,,,,,,,,,
8170," 
Environmentally efficient production 
The Volkswagen Group has set itself the goal of reducing the levels 
of the five key environmental indicators of energy and water 
consumption, waste for disposal and CO
2 and VOC emissions in 
production by 25% for each vehicle produced – starting from 2010 
levels – by 2018",,,,,,,,,,
8171," This objective applies to all of the Group’s 
production locations, derived from our ecological requirements for 
production processes that are anchored in the Group’s environ-
mental principles",,,,,,,,,,
8172," As the charts on page 148 show, we have already 
made considerable progress towards reducing all these key 
indicators",,,,,,,,,,
8173,"  
The Volkswagen Group’s brands contribute to achieving these 
goals with their own frameworks that reflect the specific features of 
their corporate culture and their brand image",,,,,,,,,,
8174," Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles have 
established “Think Blue",,,,,,,,,,
8175,"Factory”, Audi has its “ultra strategy”, 
ŠKODA calls its program “Green Factory”,  SEAT calls its program 
“
ECOMOTIVE Factory” and Bentley’s program is called 
“Environmental Factory”",,,,,,,,,,
8176," Porsche has introduced “resource-
efficient production”",,,,,,,,,,
8177," Scania and 
MAN are giving their 
commitment to the environment the names “Blue Rating” and 
“climate strategy”, respectively",,,,,,,,,,
8178,"  
We are encouraging close integration and communication 
between the brands worldwide in order to create synergies",,,,,,,,,,

8181," We record and catalog environmental measures in an IT 
system and make these available for a Group-wide exchange of best 
practice",,,,,,,,,,
8182," In the reporting period, more than 1,900 implemented 
measures in the area of environment and energy were documented 
in this system",,,,,,,,,,
8183," They serve to improve passenger car and light 
commercial vehicle production processes",,,,,,,,,,
8184," These activities are 
worthwhile not just from an environmental perspective: they also 
lead to annual savings of around €65",,,,,,,,,,

 The following examples from the year under review show the extent 
to which the measures contribute to improvement of the production 
processes and achievement of the target values for the five key 
environmental indicators:  
One important lever for reducing energy consumption is on-
demand operation of all plants",,,,,,,,,,
8187," At our Hanover plant, by switching 
from two paint dryers to one load-dependent operation we reduced 
energy requirements by around 8,000 MWh per year; this is equiv-

149 We use recycling facilities at some of the Group’s locations",,,,,,,,,,
8208," These 
process biologically precleaned waste water for reuse through the 
membrane process in order to reduce the consumption of fresh 
water",,,,,,,,,,
8209," We brought a recycling facility on stream at the Salzgitter 
location in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8210," This facility processes half the plant’s waste water 
into recycled water and uses it to feed the central cooling tower",,,,,,,,,,
8211," As a 
result of this measure, we save around 75,000 m
3
 of freshwater 
there annually; this is equivalent to around a quarter of the loca-
tion’s needs",,,,,,,,,,
8212," 
Modernizing part of the smelter at the Hanover location 
enables us to save around €3 million off our annual energy and 
material costs and reduce CO
2 emissions by around 7,000 tonnes 
per year",,,,,,,,,,
8213," Reduced oxide formation will additionally cut our use of 
materials by 70% and, as a result, also the amount of waste to 
recycle",,,,,,,,,,
8214,"  
A new application technology that enables material savings is 
being used in the paintshop at the Spanish location of Martorell",,,,,,,,,,
8215," We 
can thus reduce solvent emissions by 80 g per vehicle and make cost 
savings of €951,000 per year",,,,,,,,,,
8216," 
We are also reducing our CO
2 emissions through energy recov-
ery, among other things",,,,,,,,,,
8217," In 2015, 
MAN set up a heat recovery system 
at the ship engine test facility at its site in Frederikshavn, Denmark",,,,,,,,,,
8218," 
In the reporting period, we recovered over 3,160 MWh of thermal 
energy, which we supplied to the municipal district heating system",,,,,,,,,,
8219," 
This lowers the CO
2 emissions by 835 tonnes",,,,,,,,,,
8220,"  
The natural gas-driven combined heat and power plant that 
came on stream in Zwickau in 2014 also makes a contribution to 
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions",,,,,,,,,,
8221," In 2015, it generated 36% 
of the energy requirements at the site",,,,,,,,,,
8222," By generating our own energy, 
we reduced our CO
2 emissions by around 19,100 tonnes and 
achieved savings of roughly €8",,,,,,,,,,
8223,9 million,,,,,,,,,,
8224,"  
In Pinetown, South Africa, we have installed a photovoltaic 
system covering 6,300 m
2
 and thus created the MAN brand’s first 
climate-neutral location and South Africa’s first carbon-neutral 
production site",,,,,,,,,,
8225," With over 300 days of sun a year we are able to 
generate 810 MWh and thus not only completely supply the location, 
but also feed the surplus power into the public electricity grid",,,,,,,,,,

Green logistics 
Logistics contributes to the Volkswagen Group’s ecological orien-
tation",,,,,,,,,,
8227," For example, we analyze the entire transport chain in respect 
of CO
2 emissions",,,,,,,,,,
8228," The objective is to avoid transports or to shift to 
more environmentally friendly modes of transport and to reduce 
fuel consumption",,,,,,,,,,
8229," We are working on measures and areas of action 
for optimizing the logistics processes across the brands",,,,,,,,,,
8230,"  
In a system known as logistics process partner management, we 
are improving the pickup processes together with freight 
forwarders and suppliers in terms of cooperation, efficiency and 
capacity utilization in the transport network",,,,,,,,,,
8231," An important starting point for reducing CO 2 emissions is the 
selection of the mode of transport",,,,,,,,,,
8232," One of the most efficient options 
here is maritime transport",,,,,,,,,,
8233," The Volkswagen Group is therefore 
involved in the Clean Shipping Network (
CSN), an association of 
marine cargo owners, and is represented on its management board",,,,,,,,,,
8234," 
With the aid of the Clean Shipping Index rating tool, members of 
CSN can compare environmental efficiency figures, for example the 
emissions of individual ships on particular routes",,,,,,,,,,
8235," This allows the 
environmental footprint of maritime transport to be analyzed and 
reduced",,,,,,,,,,
8236," 
The successful use of alternative drive technologies is of decisive 
importance in environmental and economic terms",,,,,,,,,,
8237," E-mobility, gas 
and hybrid drives, fuel cells or other novel fuels offer interesting 
problem-solving approaches that we are examining for future use",,,,,,,,,,
8238," 
In maritime transport, for example, the use of liquefied natural gas 
(
LNG) is being examined because neither airborne particles nor 
sulfur oxide (SOx) are emitted",,,,,,,,,,
8239," In addition, nitrogen oxide and CO
2 
emissions are reduced",,,,,,,,,,
8240,"  
The continuous increase in efficiency in container manage-
ment also contributes to reducing emissions",,,,,,,,,,
8241," Volkswagen has one of 
Europe’s largest pools of load boards in Europe – for example for 
pallets or containers",,,,,,,,,,
8242," The Group’s container management contin-
uously works on improving the packing density, weight and folded 
volume of new load boards and on optimizing the transport routes 
for empty container shipping",,,,,,,,,,
8243," In the design and manufacture of 
new load boards, we endeavor to use recyclable materials",,,,,,,,,,
8244," As a 
result, plastic small load boards turn completely into recyclates that 
can be reused in new small load boards",,,,,,,,,,
8245," 
Last but not least, noise pollution is also taken into account 
when analyzing logistics processes",,,,,,,,,,
8246," In 2015, among other things, 
the rail wagons from 
TOUAX were incorporated into the Volkswagen 
rail network",,,,,,,,,,
8247," The use of modern technology – especially the 
composite brake pads – allows noise when braking to be reduced by 
more than 75%",,,,,,,,,,

The Group sales structure 
The Volkswagen Group’s multibrand structure helps promote the 
independence of its brands",,,,,,,,,,
8302," Nevertheless, we use overarching sales 
activities to increase sales volumes and market share, and to 
increase sales efficiency while cutting costs and improving earnings 
contributions",,,,,,,,,,
8303,"  
In the reporting period we focused particularly on dealer 
profitability: this was achieved firstly with cost-cutting programs 
and secondly by expanding the business volume for each dealer",,,,,,,,,,
8304," As 
part of our distribution network strategy, which calls for us to work 
with strong partners and leverage the potential of all business fields, 
but also in light of the difficult economic situation in some countries, 
we optimized the structure of the distribution network",,,,,,,,,,
8305," The focus 
was on a close working relationship with dealers and their 
profitability",,,,,,,,,,
8306," We use Group companies to manage our wholesale 
business in over 20 markets",,,,,,,,,,
8307," A central department makes sales 
activities more transparent and more profitable",,,,,,,,,,
8308," It creates syner-
gies between the different brands and is key to us achieving the 
goals of our Strategy 2018",,,,,,,,,,
8309," This makes it possible for the remaining 
wholesale companies to learn quickly and efficiently from the 
Group-wide benchmarking process and from the best practices 
adopted by individual companies",,,,,,,,,,
8310," A focus for the reporting period 
was optimizing our national sales companies’ logistics costs",,,,,,,,,,

Fleet customer business  
The business relationships with fleet customers are often of a long-
term nature",,,,,,,,,,
8312," This customer group guarantees more stable vehicle 
sales than the private customer segment in a volatile environment",,,,,,,,,,
8313," 
The Volkswagen Group has an established base of business fleet 
customers in Germany and the rest of Europe in particular",,,,,,,,,,
8314," Our 
extensive product offering enables us to satisfy their individual 
mobility needs from a single source",,,,,,,,,,
8315,"  
In 2015 the emissions issue led to uncertainty among those 
customers for whom CO
2 figures in particular are decisive purchase 
  reasons",,,,,,,,,,
8316," There was no reported impact on new vehicle registrations 
in the fleet customer business in 2015, however",,,,,,,,,,
8317,"  
  Used car business  
The used car business is our dealer organization’s fourth key source 
of income after the new car, services and parts businesses",,,,,,,,,,
8318," We 
ensure the profitability of the used car business by providing 
efficient processes and systems and highly qualified employees, as 
well as clear guidelines and management tools",,,,,,,,,,
8319,"  
We focus on professional used car management at both the 
wholesale and retail levels",,,,,,,,,,
8320," In order to be able to provide a suitable 
range of products and services, we are systematically expanding our 
demand-oriented offering of relatively new used cars",,,,,,,,,,
8321," Customer-
centric financial services are the basis for attractive product 
packages in this respect",,,,,,,,,,
8322," In addition, we further strengthened our 
autonomous used car brands and rolled them out internationally so 
as to ensure that our offerings also meet our customers’ needs",,,,,,,,,,
8323," 
Cross-brand activities enable us to implement internal examples of 
best practice throughout the Group, benefiting from economies of 
scale and leveraging synergies",,,,,,,,,,
8324," 
We established and standardized processes especially for used 
cars at all distribution levels, enhanced and increasingly harmo-
nized the underlying IT infrastructure, and introduced uniform 
management performance indicators",,,,,,,,,,
8325,"  
To ensure long-term success in our used car business, we attach 
considerable importance to stable residual values – in particular in 
light of the emissions issue",,,,,,,,,,
8326," We have set up system-based reporting 
functions for this purpose",,,,,,,,,,
8327,"  
 
After-sales and service 
In after-sales, the timely provision of genuine parts and individual 
service are instrumental in ensuring passenger car customer 
satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,
8328," The Volkswagen Group ensures the global supply of 
genuine parts through an after-sales network with over 120 of our 
own warehouses",,,,,,,,,,
8329," Our efficient supplier organization enables 
supply of almost all service centers worldwide within 24 hours",,,,,,,,,,
8330," Our 
passenger vehicle brands’ genuine parts and the expertise of our 
service centers represent the highest level of quality and ensure the 
safety and value retention of our customers’ vehicles",,,,,,,,,,

The Volkswagen Group regards itself as a complete provider of 
all parts and services relevant to customers in the after-sales 
business and ensures the worldwide mobility of its customers 
jointly with its partners",,,,,,,,,,

portfolio of services, for example oil and tire changes, inspection, 
maintenance and repair, in all vehicle classes",,,,,,,,,,

8339,"  
Around the world, our commercial vehicles business also 
stands for products of the highest quality and for customer 
proximity",,,,,,,,,,
8340," Fuel efficiency, maintenance and operating costs, the 
residual resale value of vehicles, and the purchase price – these are 
critical buying criteria for our customers, in addition to availability",,,,,,,,,,
8341," 
We are continually extending both our after-sales activity and our 
comprehensive service offering, and these play an important role in 
increasing customer satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,
8342,"  
Scania is adding services to its range of trucks, buses and 
engines that guarantee fuel efficiency, reliability and good vehicle

MAN provides packages with connected services optimally 
geared to customer requirements – under the 
MAN Solutions 
brand – in order to lower the total operating costs of the vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
8349," 
These packages include maintenance and repair contracts, for 
example, in conjunction with 
MAN’s proactive maintenance man-
agement service, 
MAN ServiceCare",,,,,,,,,,
8350," Active data exchange between 
vehicles, customers and the 
MAN service points is handled via the 
MAN TeleMatics integrated onboard module",,,,,,,,,,
8351,"  MAN ServiceCare 
enables operators to schedule servicing work at the most suitable 
times, increasing the availability of their vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
8352," The 
MAN services 
are available in a strong, global after-sales network with 1,470 
highly qualified service points",,,,,,,,,,

MAN 
also offers professionally prepared reconditioned parts (ecoline) 
and thus enables economically viable repair of the customer’s 
vehicle in the accustomed quality",,,,,,,,,,
8354,"  
The e-mobility challenge for sales 
The Volkswagen Group’s e-mobility strategy covers the development 
of customer-centric products and business models to complement 
its range of electric vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
8355," For example, we provide specific 
solutions in the field of mobile online services for electric vehicle 
  customers or offer the Charge&Fuel card via Volkswagen Financial 
Services AG, combining the functions of a fuel and charge card",,,,,,,,,,
8356,"  
When selecting products and partners, we take great care to 
obtain the greatest possible customer benefits and generate maxi-
mum synergies for the Group, while, at the same time, reinforcing 
the identity of our brands",,,,,,,,,,
8357,"  
We also provided additional sales and after-sales services to our 
electric vehicle customers, such as arranging for customer-specific 
charging infrastructure solutions and services",,,,,,,,,,
8358," We are further 
expanding skills in retail – geared to the challenges of e-mobility",,,,,,,,,,
8359," 
This includes the further transferal of battery repair expertise to the 
individual markets",,,,,,,,,,
8360,"   QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The quality of our products and services plays a key role in main-
taining customer satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,
8361," Customers are particularly satisfied 
and remain loyal when their expectations of a product or service are 
met or even exceeded",,,,,,,,,,
8362," Reliability, appeal and service determine 
quality as it is perceived by the customer throughout the entire pro-
duct experience",,,,,,,,,,
8363," Our objective is to positively surprise and excite 
our customers in all areas and thus win them over with our 
outstanding quality",,,,,,,,,,
8364, We continued to aspire to this objective in 2015,,,,,,,,,,
8365," 
At the same time, however, events in the reporting period showed 
us that we have to expand our current understanding of quality: 
going forward, Quality Assurance will focus more intensively than 
before on the compliance of our products",,,,,,,,,,
8366,"  
As a result of the emissions issue, we will place even greater 
emphasis than in the past on our quality management system",,,,,,,,,,
8367," A 
process-driven approach across all business areas will be rein-
forced throughout the Group",,,,,,,,,,
8368," Quality management in the Volks-
wagen Group is based on the standard 
ISO 9001: the requirements 
of this standard must be met to obtain the operating license and 
type approval for producing and selling our vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
8369," The standard 
was revised in the reporting period; one of the main substantive 
revisions made concerns risk assessments for non-compliant pro-
cesses",,,,,,,,,,
8370," To ensure that these and other revisions are uniformly 
implemented throughout the Group, Quality Assurance developed a 
concept in 2015, setting out guidelines, recommendations and tips 
for the quality management consultants for the individual brands, 
and supported them in the process of implementation",,,,,,,,,,
8371," 
As a further step, we have reinforced application of the dual 
control principle – mutual support and control between the divi-
sions – and built up further core expertise in quality assurance",,,,,,,,,,
8372," This 
includes setting up control mechanisms between Technical Develop-
ment and Quality Assurance, and carrying out checks on the 
compliance of our products",,,,,,,,,,
8373," A number of organizational measures 
were taken to establish a process of checks to be carried out by 
several individuals in the approval of powertrains",,,,,,,,,,

153 Based on these and other measures, we intend to ensure within the 
scope of Quality Assurance that all legal requirements imposed on 
us as a manufacturer and on our products are met",,,,,,,,,,
8376," 
 
Observing regional requirements 
Our customers’ wishes and desires in terms of new vehicle models 
vary in the individual regions of the world",,,,,,,,,,
8377," Identifying these specific 
regional factors and prioritizing them is an important task for 
Quality Assurance, so that they can then be reflected in the develop-
ment of new products and the production of established vehicle 
models",,,,,,,,,,
8378," Factors such as the available fuel quality, road conditions, 
traffic density, country-specific usage patterns and, last but not least, 
local legislation play a key role in this process",,,,,,,,,,
8379," We mainly use 
market studies and customer surveys to capture the region-specific 
customer requirements",,,,,,,,,,
8380," 
Product and supplier quality 
In the reporting period, the large number of product start-ups made 
high demands on Quality Assurance",,,,,,,,,,
8381," We nevertheless managed to 
maintain the high quality of the previous years",,,,,,,,,,
8382," Our suppliers also 
made important contributions to this",,,,,,,,,,
8383," We expect them to use 
sustainable practices, as well as to deliver the highest product 
quality and reliability of supply",,,,,,,,,,
8384," 
One of our central concerns is to establish innovative tech-
nologies that are installed in new vehicles in the respective markets 
without any complaints",,,,,,,,,,
8385," We are therefore placing even greater 
emphasis than before on the topics of software quality and data 
security",,,,,,,,,,
8386," Quality Assurance supports and analyzes new vehicle 
projects long before customers experience a new product",,,,,,,,,,
8387," We 
consistently aim to make our products even better and even more 
reliable, while at the same time taking as many customer wishes as 
possible into consideration and factoring in regional requirements",,,,,,,,,,
8388,"  
In addition, Quality Assurance defines high quality targets and 
standards for the Volkswagen Group, and monitors compliance 
with them",,,,,,,,,,
8389," It also identifies the cause of any faults and manages the 
process for removing them",,,,,,,,,,
8390," In 2015, we continued to standardize 
our fault removal process, so that we can respond even more 
quickly and effectively to any problems in the vehicle",,,,,,,,,,
8391," As a result, we 
can increase customer satisfaction, and at the same time reduce 
warranty and ex gratia repair costs",,,,,,,,,,
8392," 
Service quality 
We also aim to improve the quality of our service offerings 
worldwide",,,,,,,,,,
8393," As in the previous year, we therefore further optimized 
our warranty and ex gratia repair instruments in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8394," As the direct 
interface with our customers, authorized dealers also offered us 
additional opportunities: we are working on identifying any 
problems that may be revealed in the emotional moment of vehicle 
handover at an early stage, and on preventing such problems from 
occurring",,,,,,,,,,
8395," One measure taken in this respect is the introduction of  
  “dealer plant teams” – a proven concept that we repeated for the 
launch of the Volkswagen Touran: employees from different work 
areas inspect the quality of the vehicles delivered to the local dealer 
and feed back details of any problems to the manufacturing plant in 
question",,,,,,,,,,
8396," 
  Group quality standards 
Whether they are buying a passenger car, commercial vehicle or 
motorcycle, our customers expect perfect quality from all vehicles of 
the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
8397," So for more than 40 years now, auditors 
have been deployed around the world to carry out an assessment 
from the customer’s perspective of the vehicles ready for delivery",,,,,,,,,,
8398," 
We continually revise the quality standards applied for these vehicle 
audits in line with changes in requirements",,,,,,,,,,
8399," In 2015, based on the 
guiding principles of precision and perfection, Quality Assurance 
prepared a truck-specific audit in conjunction with the Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles, Scania and 
MAN brands, and trained and 
certified the product auditors accordingly",,,,,,,,,,
8400,"  
Our products stand out for their precision, perfect workman-
ship and high-quality appeal",,,,,,,,,,
8401," Quality Assurance contributes to this 
with instruments such as master jigs and function cubes",,,,,,,,,,
8402," This 
testing equipment in use at Volkswagen ensures that we meet the 
high quality requirements imposed on our vehicle construction 
processes",,,,,,,,,,
8403," For vehicle interiors and exteriors, Quality Assurance 
assesses the overall appeal, panel gaps, looks and feel, functionality 
and assembly capability",,,,,,,,,,
8404," Where necessary, we adjust components 
or make changes to their design",,,,,,,,,,
8405," As the importance of appeal 
continues to grow in the truck segment, Quality Assurance ran a 
comprehensive training program in 2015, in cooperation with 
Scania",,,,,,,,,,

rience Day to focus on female engineering and computer science 
students and graduates, so as to recruit them for technical positions 
with us",,,,,,,,,,
8512,"  
This increased proportion of qualified women joining the 
Company will enable us to steadily lift the proportion of female 
executives in the coming years",,,,,,,,,,

target quotas: by the end of 2016, the proportion of women in the 
first management level is to be 9",,,,,,,,,,

rose to 10",,,,,,,,,,
8519,"3%, compared with 10",,,,,,,,,,
8520,2% in the previous year,,,,,,,,,,
8521," We are 
encouraging this development with a number of different measures: 
for example, 2015 saw the second group to embark on the cross-
brand Management Mentoring Program, designed to support 
women on the way to management positions, with 63 participants 
from the Volkswagen Group in Germany",,,,,,,,,,
8522," In addition, Volkswagen 
  offers the “Compass” program to specifically encourage women 
with high potential in their decision to aim for a career in manage-
ment",,,,,,,,,,
8523," In the reporting period, 60 women from Volkswagen AG – as 
well as the companies Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG and Autovision GmbH – took part in this 
program",,,,,,,,,,
8524," 
In addition, Volkswagen intends to raise the proportion of 
women among its skilled workers and master-level workers in 
Germany to 10%; in fiscal year 2015, the proportion of women in 
the Volkswagen Group in Germany (without Scania,  MAN and 
Porsche) was 4",,,,,,,,,,

skills development and performance evaluation have been in place 
at Volkswagen AG since 2010",,,,,,,,,,
8550," These criteria apply to the entire 
workforce – from vocational trainees to senior executives",,,,,,,,,,
8551," They are 
underpinned by concrete incentive systems in the remuneration 
structure",,,,,,,,,,
8552,"  
Volkswagen AG’s employees covered by collective pay 
agreements have a remuneration system that comprises three main 
elements: 
> basic pay in the form of a competitive monthly salary; 
> a performance-related pay component that additionally 
recognizes the achievements of each individual employee; and 
> the right to a bonus arrangement anchored in the collective pay 
agreements",,,,,,,,,,
8553," This three-tier remuneration system has proven its worth as a tool 
for the workforce to participate in the Company’s success",,,,,,,,,,
8554," It 
contributes to rewarding individual performance while main-
taining competitiveness at the same time",,,,,,,,,,
8555," For this reason, it is 
increasingly becoming standard practice in the Group – at Audi and  ŠKODA, as well as at the Volkswagen Group Rus’ location in Kaluga 
and at Volkswagen de México, among other places",,,,,,,,,,
8556," 
 
Employee participation  
Codetermination and employee participation are important pillars 
of our human resources strategy",,,,,,,,,,

levels of technical expertise and a strong team spirit among its 
employees",,,,,,,,,,
8558," The Company invests in its people, offers employees 
attractive opportunities for development and promotes a good 
working climate",,,,,,,,,,
8559," This includes employees’ opinions, assessments 
and constructive criticism being heard",,,,,,,,,,
8560,"  
One tool we use to this end throughout the Group is the opinion 
survey, through which employees can actively help shape the 
Company",,,,,,,,,,
8561," With this uniform, Group-wide employee survey, we 
regularly gather information about employee satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,
8562," To 
fundamentally revise the work climate index, in spring 2015 we 
suspended Group-wide implementation of the tool",,,,,,,,,,
8563," In the future,

strength is that, in exchanging best practice, we pool our 
employees’ knowledge across brands and regions and leverage 
this across the entire Group",,,,,,,,,,

> Number one for intelligent mobility 
We understand intelligent mobility to mean the challenge of 
offering mobility and comfort and at the same time protecting the 
environment and reducing traffic waste",,,,,,,,,,
8701," This requires the 
efficient interplay of people, infrastructure, technologies and 
means of transport",,,,,,,,,,
8702," 
The Group environmental strategy is based on a holistic approach 
that is geared to the value chain and thus involves all divisions",,,,,,,,,,
8703," We 
have set ambitious, measurable targets in these areas and are 
pursuing them systematically",,,,,,,,,,
8704," This includes reducing CO
2 emis-
sions from our European new car fleet and designing each new 
model generation to be more efficient than its predecessor",,,,,,,,,,

production, we want to reduce the levels of the five key environ-
mental indicators of energy and water consumption, waste for 
disposal and CO
2 and VOCs emissions by 25% for each vehicle 
produced by 2018, in comparison with 2010",,,,,,,,,,
8706,"  
We can only reach our ambitious goals if we firmly entrench 
environmentally relevant issues in our organizational and decision-
making processes",,,,,,,,,,

ment department’s environmental goals are also anchored in the 
environmental management system",,,,,,,,,,

department have certification under 
ISO 14001, and also, since 
2009, under 
ISO/TR 14062",,,,,,,,,,

The Group-wide entrenchment of environmental protection 
should also be reflected in our employees’ environmental thinking 
and actions",,,,,,,,,,
8715," This, however, assumes that they are appropriately 
informed and trained",,,,,,,,,,

mental management officers around the world, who are working on 
building a broad basis for environmental protection within the 
Group",,,,,,,,,,

how of all our brands’ and regions’ employees, cross-brand and

GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
In our plans, we assume that the global economic growth in 2016 
will be level with the previous year",,,,,,,,,,

in the financial markets and structural deficits in individual coun-
tries",,,,,,,,,,

probability be muted in many emerging markets",,,,,,,,,,

The passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region look set to 
continue their growth trajectory in 2016 at a similar pace",,,,,,,,,,

saturated, new registrations in North America in 2016 will probably 
be down appreciably on the prior-year figure",,,,,,,,,,
8871,"  
Demand in the Brazilian market in 2016 will be substantially 
lower than the already weak figure recorded in the previous year",,,,,,,,,,

This is attributable to the economic conditions, which continue to 
be weighed down by the muted business climate and negative 
growth rates",,,,,,,,,,
8873,"  
For China, the world’s largest truck market, the significant 
market decline in 2015 will result in pent-up demand, so regis-

In the bus markets that are relevant for the Volkswagen Group, 
we expect that demand will decrease perceptibly in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
8877," Following 
the sharp increase in Western Europe in 2015, we are likely to see 
demand dip slightly in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
8878," For Central and Eastern Europe, we 
are forecasting that the volume of demand will be down signifi-
cantly on the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
8879," In South America, new registrations 
will probably also be substantially lower than the prior-year level",,,,,,,,,,

For the period 2017 to 2020, we expect moderate growth overall 
in the bus markets that are relevant for the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,

  TRENDS IN THE MARKETS FOR POWER ENGINEERING 
We expect the overall difficult market environment and thus the 
price pressure in the power engineering segment to persist in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
8882,"  
We anticipate that the order volume for two-stroke engines, 
used in merchant shipping in 2016, will be similar to the prior-year 
figure",,,,,,,,,,
8883," Calls for greater energy efficiency and low pollutant emis-
sions will have a significant influence on ship designs in the future",,,,,,,,,,
8884," 
We expect to see continuing high demand for special-purpose ships 
such as cruise ships and government vessels",,,,,,,,,,
8885," Despite long-term 
positive growth factors for offshore applications, expectations are 
that new orders will be at a low level in 2016 because of the persis-
tently low oil price",,,,,,,,,,
8886," Overall, we estimate that the marine market will 
be on a level with the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
8887," The competitive pressure will 
continue unabated",,,,,,,,,,
8888,"  
Demand for energy correlates strongly with macroeconomic 
and demographic trends, especially in developing countries  
and emerging markets",,,,,,,,,,
8889," The global trend toward decentralized 
power stations and gas-based applications shows no sign of slowing 
down",,,,,,,,,,
8890," This development is supported in particular by increasing 
improvements in the liquid gas infrastructure",,,,,,,,,,
8891," We anticipate that 
demand will increase slightly year-on-year in 2016, but will remain 
at a low overall level",,,,,,,,,,
8892,"  
Both the processing and the oil and gas industries are expected 
to experience a persistently difficult market environment in fiscal 
year 2016, resulting in high price and competitive pressure",,,,,,,,,,
8893," This is 
due to expectations that oil prices will remain low and unfavorable 
economic and political conditions will prevail in some relevant 
markets",,,,,,,,,,
8894," We consequently envisage that in 2016 the market for 
turbomachinery will also settle at the previous year’s low level",,,,,,,,,,
8895," 
Any substantial improvement in the German market for wind 
farms cannot yet be expected for 2016",,,,,,,,,,

For the period 2017 to 2020, demand is expected to grow in the 
power engineering market",,,,,,,,,,

DEMAND FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 
We expect automotive financial services to continue to grow in 
importance worldwide in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
8898," We anticipate that demand for 
financial services will increase more strongly in those emerging 
markets in which market penetration is currently low, such as 
China",,,,,,,,,,

there will be a further shift in the offering towards enabling

EXCHANGE RATE TRENDS 
The global economy lost a little of its momentum in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8908," Falling 
energy and commodity prices, uncertainty about the change in the 
Chinese growth model and the declining confidence in the eco-
nomic stability of emerging markets resulted in further weakening 
of the currencies of those countries",,,,,,,,,,
8909," The euro stabilized at a low 
level against the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi and sterling in the 
course of the year",,,,,,,,,,
8910," Despite appreciating temporarily, the Russian 
ruble remained weak, losing substantial ground again in the 
second half of the year",,,,,,,,,,
8911," For 2016, we are forecasting that the euro 
will gain some strength against the US dollar, Chinese renminbi, 
sterling and other key currencies",,,,,,,,,,
8912," The expectation is that the 
Russian ruble will remain weak",,,,,,,,,,
8913," We currently assume that these 
trends will continue in the period 2017 to 2020",,,,,,,,,,
8914," There is still a 
general event risk – defined as the risk arising from unforeseen 
market developments",,,,,,,,,,
8915," 
 
INTEREST RATE TRENDS 
Interest rates remained extremely low in fiscal year 2015 due to the 
continuation of expansionary monetary policy and the challenging 
overall economic environment",,,,,,,,,,
8916," In the major Western industrialized 
nations, key interest rates persisted at a historic low level",,,,,,,,,,
8917," While it 
became apparent in the 
USA and the UK that the extremely loose 
monetary policy was gradually drawing to an end, the European 
Central Bank continued to pursue this course",,,,,,,,,,
8918," In light of further 
expansionary monetary policy measures in the eurozone, we there-
fore consider it unlikely that interest rates will rise significantly in 
2016",,,,,,,,,,
8919," In the 
USA and the UK, however, we can expect to see a 
moderate increase in interest rates",,,,,,,,,,
8920," For the period 2017 to 2020, 
we anticipate a gradual rise in interest rates",,,,,,,,,,
8921,"  
 
  COMMODITY PRICE TRENDS 
Many commodity prices decreased further in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
8922," This was 
principally due to increasing excess supply in the global markets, 
but also to weaker economic growth in China and the strong US 
dollar",,,,,,,,,,
8923," Assuming somewhat stronger growth in the global economy, 
we expect prices of most exchange-traded raw materials in 2016 to 
fluctuate around the current level",,,,,,,,,,
8924," Provided there is a further 
recovery, we believe that commodity prices will rise in the period 
2017 to 2020",,,,,,,,,,

STRATEGIC SALES FOCUS

Group have been designed for managing a multibrand organization",,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate the entry into new markets for more Group brands, 
we will further expand our multibrand structure, particularly in the 
growth markets",,,,,,,,,,
8961," We will also strengthen our customer focus across 
all sales levels and in customer service, for which we are continually 
enhancing employee qualifications in addition to optimizing our 
processes and systems to reflect shifts in customer requirements as 
well as changing markets and technologies, in particular digitali-
zation",,,,,,,,,,

lion will be made in the Automotive Division",,,,,,,,,,

Scheduled capex (investments in property, plant and equip-
ment, investment property and intangible assets, excluding capital-
ized development costs) will amount to approximately €12 billion, 
down on the figures of the previous planning round",,,,,,,,,,
8974," The ratio of 
capex to sales revenue in 2016 will be at a level of 6 – 7%",,,,,,,,,,
8975," The 
majority of capex will be spent on new products, the continued 
rollout and development of the modular toolkit and the completion 
of ongoing capacity expansion",,,,,,,,,,
8976," These relate, for example, to 
product start-ups such as the next generation of the Golf and the 
Audi Q5, the new Crafter production facility in Poland plus upfront 
investments for the modular electrification toolkit",,,,,,,,,,
8977," Roughly 50% of 
capex will be made at the Group’s 28 locations in Germany",,,,,,,,,,
8978," 
Besides capex, investing activities will include additions of €5 
billion to capitalized development costs",,,,,,,,,,
8979," Among other things, these 
reflect upfront expenditures in connection with compliance with 
environmental standards and the extension and updating of our 
model range",,,,,,,,,,

advancement of electric drives in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, 
Audi and Porsche brands",,,,,,,,,,

168  The investments in new facilities and models, as well as in the 
development of alternative drives and modular toolkits, are laying 
the foundations for profitable, sustainable growth at Volkswagen",,,,,,,,,,

These investments also include commitments arising from 
decisions taken in previous fiscal years",,,,,,,,,,

company LeasePlan Corporation N",,,,,,,,,,

concluded",,,,,,,,,,
8987, This transaction resulted in a positive effect of €2,,,,,,,,,,

lion on the Automotive Division’s investing activities",,,,,,,,,,
8989," 
We intend to finance our investments in the Automotive 
Division using internally generated funds and expect cash flows 
from operating activities to exceed the Automotive Division’s invest-
ment requirements",,,,,,,,,,
8990," As a result of the effects of the emissions issue, 
net cash flow in the Automotive Division will probably be signifi-
cantly lower than in the previous year",,,,,,,,,,

outflows for the legal handling of the emissions issue",,,,,,,,,,
8992,"

payable to other shareholders associated with the control and profit 
and loss transfer agreement with 
MAN SE",,,,,,,,,,
8994," Our joint ventures in 
China are not consolidated and are therefore also not included in 
the above figures",,,,,,,,,,
8995," These joint ventures will invest €4 billion in capex 
in 2016, to be financed from the companies’ own funds",,,,,,,,,,

In the Financial Services Division we are planning higher 
investments in 2016 than in the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
8997," We expect the 
growth in lease assets and in receivables from leasing, customer 
and dealer financing to lead to funds tied up in working capital, of 
which around 45% will be financed from the gross cash flow",,,,,,,,,,
8998," As is 
common in the sector, the remaining funds needed will be met 
primarily through asset-backed securities, customer deposits from 
direct banking business, unsecured bonds on the money and capital 
market as well as through the use of international credit lines",,,,,,,,,,

TARGETS FOR VALUE-BASED MANAGEMENT

the minimum required rate of return on invested capital defined for 
the Automotive Division remains unchanged at 9%",,,,,,,,,,

The Group is to have a new management model, which is being 
implemented since the beginning of 2016",,,,,,,,,,

follows:  
At Group level, the management structure will be based even 
more consistently on the modular toolkit system",,,,,,,,,,
9007," In addition to 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, 
SEAT and ŠKODA as the volume brands, 
Audi, Lamborghini and Ducati will form a brand group and Porsche 
will be in a brand group with Bentley and Bugatti",,,,,,,,,,
9008," The commercial 
vehicles group with Scania and 
MAN as well as the Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles brand will remain in place, as will the Power 
Engineering and Financial Services business areas",,,,,,,,,,
9009," 
Furthermore, Group functions will focus on efficiency and 
topics for the future",,,,,,,,,,
9010," For this, organizational units will be set up for, 
among others, digitalization, the toolkit and product strategy, new 
business fields, as well as cooperation and equity investments",,,,,,,,,,
9011,"  
Existing corporate bodies, structures and processes will be 
streamlined at Group level, in particular by strengthening the 
individual brands and regions",,,,,,,,,,

production and sales functions will be strategically assigned at 
Group level to the area for which the Chairman of the Board of 
Management is responsible",,,,,,,,,,

Vehicles/Power Engineering Business Area will in future be 
presented as two separate business areas in accordance with the 
segment reporting: Commercial Vehicles Business Area and Power 
Engineering Business Area",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Expected Developments  
169 SUMMARY OF EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS The Volkswagen Group’s Board of Management expects the global 
economy to record the same level of growth in 2016 as in the 
previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9020," Risks will arise from turbulence in the financial 
markets and structural deficits in individual countries",,,,,,,,,,
9021," In addition, 
growth prospects continue to be hurt by geopolitical tensions and 
conflicts",,,,,,,,,,
9022," We expect the economic upturn to continue in most 
industrialized nations, with moderate rates of expansion overall",,,,,,,,,,
9023," As 
in the previous year, growth will in all probability be muted in many 
emerging markets",,,,,,,,,,
9024," We expect the strongest rates of expansion in 
Asia’s emerging economies",,,,,,,,,,
9025," 
The trend in the automotive industry closely follows global eco-
nomic developments",,,,,,,,,,
9026," Competition in the international automotive 
markets is likely to intensify further",,,,,,,,,,
9027,"  
We expect trends in the passenger car markets in the individual 
regions to be mixed in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9028," Overall, growth in global demand for 
new vehicles will probably be slower than in the reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
9029," 
We anticipate that the demand volume in Western Europe and the 
German passenger car market will be in line with the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9030," 
In the Central and Eastern European markets, demand for 
passenger cars is estimated to be under the weak prior-year figure",,,,,,,,,,
9031," 
In North America, we expect last year’s positive trend to continue at 
a slightly weaker pace",,,,,,,,,,
9032," The volumes of the South American markets 
will probably fall noticeably short of the prior-year figures",,,,,,,,,,
9033," The 
passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region look set to 
continue their growth path at a similar pace",,,,,,,,,,
9034," 
Global demand for light commercial vehicles will probably see a 
slight increase in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9035, We expect trends to vary from region to region,,,,,,,,,,
9036,"  
In the markets for mid-sized and heavy trucks that are relevant 
for the Volkswagen Group, new registrations in 2016 are set to drop 
slightly below the prior-year level, while new registrations of buses 
in the relevant markets will probably be noticeably lower than in the 
previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9037," 
We expect automotive financial services to continue to grow in 
importance worldwide in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9038,"  
The Volkswagen Group is well positioned to deal with the mixed 
developments in the global automotive markets",,,,,,,,,,
9039," Our broad, selec-
tively expanded product range featuring the latest generation of 
engines as well as a variety of alternative drives puts us in a good 
position globally compared with our competitors",,,,,,,,,,
9040," The Group’s 
strengths include in particular its unique brand portfolio, its steadily 
growing presence in all major world markets and its wide selection 
of financial services",,,,,,,,,,
9041," Our range of models span from motorcycles 
through compact, sports and luxury cars to heavy trucks and buses, 
and covers almost all segments",,,,,,,,,,
9042," The Volkswagen Group’s brands 
will press ahead with their product initiative in 2016, modernizing 
and expanding their offering by introducing new models",,,,,,,,,,
9043," Our goal is to offer all customers the mobility and innovations they need, 
sustainably strengthening our competitive position in the process",,,,,,,,,,
9044," 
We expect that, on the whole, deliveries to customers of the 
Volkswagen Group in 2016 will be on a level with the previous year 
amid persistently challenging market conditions, with a growing 
volume in China",,,,,,,,,,
9045," 
In addition to the emissions issue, the highly competitive 
environment as well as interest rate and exchange rate volatility and 
fluctuations in raw materials prices all pose challenges",,,,,,,,,,
9046," We antici-
pate positive effects from the efficiency programs implemented by 
all brands and from the modular toolkits",,,,,,,,,,
9047," 
Depending on the economic conditions – particularly in South 
America and Russia – and the exchange rate development and in 
light of the emissions issue, we expect 2016 sales revenue for the 
Volkswagen Group to be down by as much as 5% on the prior-year 
figure",,,,,,,,,,
9048," In terms of the Group’s operating result, we anticipate an 
operating return on sales of between 5",,,,,,,,,,
9049,0% and 6,,,,,,,,,,
9050,0% in 2016,,,,,,,,,,
9051,"  
In the Passenger Cars Business Area we expect a sharp decrease 
in sales revenue, with an operating return on sales in the antici-
pated range of 5",,,,,,,,,,
9052,5 – 6,,,,,,,,,,
9053,5%,,,,,,,,,,
9054," With sales revenue in the Commercial 
Vehicles Business Area remaining essentially unchanged, we 
anticipate that the operating return on sales will be between 2",,,,,,,,,,
9055,"0% 
and 4",,,,,,,,,,
9056,0%,,,,,,,,,,
9057," We expect sales revenue in the Power Engineering 
Business Area to be perceptibly lower than the prior-year figure, 
with a significantly reduced operating result",,,,,,,,,,
9058," For the Financial 
Services Division, we are forecasting sales revenue and the 
operating result at the prior-year level",,,,,,,,,,
9059,"  
At Group level, we still endeavor to achieve a sustainable return 
on sales before tax of at least 8%",,,,,,,,,,
9060," 
In the Automotive Division, the ratio of capex to sales revenue 
will fluctuate around a level of 6 – 7% in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9061," The return on invest-
ment (
ROI) will be up substantially year-on-year, above the mini-
mum required rate of return on invested capital of 9%",,,,,,,,,,
9062," As a result of 
the effects of the emissions issue, net cash flow will probably be 
significantly lower than in the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9063," Our unchanged stated 
goal is continue our solid liquidity policy",,,,,,,,,,
9064," 
The Group’s new structure with more decentralized responsi-
bility will strengthen our brands and regions and increase our 
proximity to customers",,,,,,,,,,
9065," In addition, we are working to make even 
more focused use of the advantages of our multibrand group by 
continuously developing new technologies and toolkits",,,,,,,,,,
9066," The com-
mitment and considerable technical expertise of our staff are key 
prerequisites to mastering the current and future challenges facing 
us and to being successful",,,,,,,,,,
9067," The central concern of the Volkswagen 
Group’s human resources work is therefore to promote the expertise 
and motivation of our employees",,,,,,,,,,
9068," Disciplined cost and investment 
management and the continuous optimization of our processes are 
integral elements of the Volkswagen Group’s strategy",,,,,,,,,,

CONTROL SYSTEM AT VOLKSWAGEN 
Only by promptly identifying, accurately assessing and effectively 
and efficiently managing the risks and opportunities arising from 
our business activities can we ensure the Volkswagen Group’s 
sustainable success",,,,,,,,,,
9073," The aim of the 
RMS/ICS is to identify potential 
risks at an early stage so that suitable countermeasures can be 
taken to avert the threat of loss to the Company, and any risks that 
might jeopardize its continued existence can be ruled out",,,,,,,,,,
9074," 
Assessing the probability and extent of future events and devel-
opments is, by its nature, subject to uncertainty",,,,,,,,,,
9075," We are therefore 
aware that even the best 
RMS cannot foresee all potential risks and 
even the best 
ICS can never completely prevent irregular acts",,,,,,,,,,
9076," 
STRUCTURE OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL 
CONTROL SYSTEM AT VOLKSWAGEN 
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s  RMS/ICS is 
based on the internationally recognized 
COSO framework for 
enterprise risk management (
COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission)",,,,,,,,,,
9077," In the reporting 
period, Volkswagen again pursued a holistic, integrated approach 
that combines a risk management system, an internal control 
system and a compliance management system ( CMS) within a single 
management strategy (governance, risk and compliance strategy)",,,,,,,,,,
9078," 
Structuring the 
RMS/ICS in accordance with the COSO framework 
for enterprise risk management ensures that potential risks are 
covered in full; opportunities are not recorded",,,,,,,,,,
9079," Uniform Group 
principles are used as the basis for managing risks in a consistent 
manner",,,,,,,,,,
9080," 
With this approach we not only fulfil legal requirements, partic-
ularly with regard to the financial reporting process, but we are also 
able to manage significant risks to the Group holistically, i",,,,,,,,,,
9081,e,,,,,,,,,,
9082," by 
incorporating both tangible and intangible criteria",,,,,,,,,,
9083,"  
Another key element of the 
RMS/ICS at Volkswagen is the three 
lines of defense model, a basic element required, among others, by 
the European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing 
(
ECIIA)",,,,,,,,,,
9084," In line with this model, the Volkswagen Group’s  RMS/ICS 
has three lines of defense that are designed to protect the Company 
from significant risks occurring",,,,,,,,,,
9085," 
No significant changes were made to the 
RMS/ICS in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
9086," In 
connection with the examination of the emissions issue, we started 
to analyze possible viable enhancements to the system in the 
reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
9087," These include, among other things, reinforcing 
the internal control system in the area of product compliance",,,,,,,,,,

First line of defense: operational risk management 
The primary line of defense comprises the operational risk man-
agement and internal control systems at the individual Group 
companies and business units",,,,,,,,,,
9092," The 
RMS/ICS is an integral part of 
the Volkswagen Group’s structure and workflows",,,,,,,,,,
9093," Events that may 
give rise to risk are identified and assessed locally in the divisions 
and at the investees",,,,,,,,,,
9094," Countermeasures are introduced immediately, 
their effects are assessed and the information is incorporated into 
the planning in a timely manner",,,,,,,,,,
9095," The results of the operational risk 
management process are incorporated into budget planning and 
financial control on an ongoing basis",,,,,,,,,,
9096," The targets agreed in the 
budget planning rounds are continually reviewed in revolving 
planning updates",,,,,,,,,,
9097," 
At the same time, the results of risk mitigation measures that 
have already been taken are incorporated into the monthly fore-
casts on further business development without delay",,,,,,,,,,
9098," This means 
that the Board of Management also has access to an overall picture 
of the current risk situation via the documented reporting channels 
during the year",,,,,,,,,,
9099," 
The minimum requirements for the operational risk manage-
ment and internal control system are set out for the entire Group in 
uniform guidelines",,,,,,,,,,
9100," These also include a process for the timely 
reporting of material risks",,,,,,,,,,
9101,"  Second line of defense: identifying systemic risks using the regular 
Governance, Risk and Compliance process 
In addition to the units’ ongoing operational risk management, the 
Group Governance, Risk and Compliance (
GRC) department each 
year sends standardized surveys on the risk situation and the 
effectiveness of the 
RMS/ICS to the material Group companies and 
units worldwide (regular 
GRC process)",,,,,,,,,,
9102," The feedback is used to 
update the overall picture of the potential risk situation and assess 
the effectiveness of the system",,,,,,,,,,
9103," 
Each systemic risk reported is assessed using the expected like-
lihood of occurrence and various risk criteria (financial and non-
financial)",,,,,,,,,,
9104," In addition, the measures taken to manage and control 
risk are documented at management level",,,,,,,,,,
9105," This means that risks 
are assessed in the context of any risk management measures 
initiated, i",,,,,,,,,,
9106,e,,,,,,,,,,
9107, in a net analysis,,,,,,,,,,
9108," In addition to strategic, operational 
and reporting risks, risks arising from potential compliance vio-
lations are also integrated into this process",,,,,,,,,,
9109," Moreover, the effective-
ness of key risk management and control measures is tested and 
any weaknesses identified in the process are reported and rectified",,,,,,,,,,
9110,"  
All Group companies and units selected from among the 
entities in the consolidated Group on the basis of materiality and 
risk criteria were subject to the regular 
GRC process in fiscal year 
2015",,,,,,,,,,
9111, Only the Scania brand was excluded,,,,,,,,,,
9112,"  
The consolidated Scania brand has not yet been included in the 
Volkswagen Group’s risk management system due to various pro-
visions of Swedish company law, but its gradual inclusion is planned 
from 2016 onward",,,,,,,,,,
9113," According to Scania’s corporate governance 
report, risk management and risk assessment are integral parts of 
corporate management",,,,,,,,,,
9114," Risk areas at Scania are evaluated by the 
brand’s Controlling department and reflected in the financial 
reporting",,,,,,,,,,
9115,"  
Third line of defense: checks by Group Internal Audit 
Group Internal Audit helps the Board of Management to monitor 
the various divisions and corporate units within the Group",,,,,,,,,,
9116," It 
regularly checks the risk early warning system and the structure 
and implementation of the 
RMS/ICS and the CMS as part of its 
independent audit procedures",,,,,,,,,,

RISK EARLY WARNING SYSTEM IN LINE WITH THE KONTRAG 
The Company’s risk situation is ascertained, assessed and docu-
mented in accordance with the requirements of the Gesetz zur 
Kontrolle und Transparenz im Unternehmensbereich (KonTraG  
– German Act on Control and Transparency in Business)",,,,,,,,,,
9119," The 
requirements for a risk early warning system are met through the 
elements of the 
RMS/ICS described above (first and second lines of 
defense)",,,,,,,,,,
9120," Independently of this, the external auditors check both 
the processes and procedures implemented in this respect and the 
adequacy of the documentation on an annual basis",,,,,,,,,,
9121," The plausibility 
and adequacy of the risk reports are examined on a random basis in 
detailed interviews with the divisions and companies concerned 
that also involve the external auditors",,,,,,,,,,
9122," The latter assessed our risk 
early warning system based on this volume of data and established 
that the risks identified were presented and communicated 
accurately",,,,,,,,,,
9123," The risk early warning system therefore meets the 
requirements of the KonTraG",,,,,,,,,,
9124,"  
In addition, the Financial Services Division is subject both to 
scheduled examinations as part of the audit of the annual financial 
statements and to also unscheduled audits, in particular by the 
Banking Supervision Committee of the European Central Bank 
(
ECB-SSM) and by the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungs-
aufsicht (BaFin – the German Federal Financial Supervisory Author-
ity) within the meaning of section 44 of the Kreditwesengesetz (
KWG 
– German Banking Act), as well as examinations by the Prüfungs-
verband deutscher Banken (Auditing Association of German Banks)",,,,,,,,,,
9125,"   Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management system and 
the internal control system 
The RMS/ICS is regularly optimized as part of our continuous 
monitoring and improvement processes",,,,,,,,,,
9126," In the process, equal 
consideration is given to both internal and external requirements",,,,,,,,,,
9127," 
External experts assist in the continuous enhancement of our 
RMS/ICS on a case-by-case basis",,,,,,,,,,
9128," The objective of the monitoring 
and improvements is to ensure the effectiveness of the 
RMS/ICS",,,,,,,,,,
9129," 
The results culminate in both regular and event-driven reporting to 
the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG",,,,,,,,,,
9130," 
 
THE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTEGRATED INTERNAL CONTROL 
SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS 
The accounting-related part of the  RMS/ICS that is relevant for the 
financial statements of Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group 
comprises measures that are intended to ensure the complete, 
accurate and timely transmission of the information required for 
the preparation of the financial statements of Volkswagen AG, the 
consolidated financial statements and the combined Group manage-
ment report",,,,,,,,,,
9131," These measures are designed to minimize the risk of 
material misstatement in the accounts and in the external reporting",,,,,,,,,,
9132," 
 
Main features of the risk management and integrated internal 
control system relevant for the financial reporting process 
The Volkswagen Group’s accounting is basically organized along 
decentralized lines",,,,,,,,,,
9133," For the most part, accounting duties are per-
formed by the consolidated companies themselves or entrusted to 
the Group’s shared service centers",,,,,,,,,,
9134," In principle, the audited finan-
cial statements of Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries prepared in 
accordance with 
IFRSs and the Volkswagen  IFRS accounting 
manual are transmitted to the Group in encrypted form",,,,,,,,,,
9135," A standard 
market product is used for encryption",,,,,,,,,,
9136," 
The Volkswagen 
IFRS accounting manual, which has been 
prepared using external expert opinions in certain cases, ensures 
the application of uniform accounting policies based on the 
requirements applicable to the parent",,,,,,,,,,
9137," In particular, it includes 
more detailed guidance on the application of legal requirements 
and industry-specific issues",,,,,,,,,,
9138," Components of the reporting packages 
required to be prepared by the Group companies are also set out in 
detail there and requirements established for the presentation and 
settlement of intragroup transactions and the balance recon-
ciliation process that builds on this",,,,,,,,,,

173 Control activities at Group level include analyzing and, if necessary, 
adjusting the data reported in the financial statements presented by 
the subsidiaries, taking into account the reports submitted by the 
auditors and the outcome of the meetings on the financial 
statements with representatives of the individual companies",,,,,,,,,,
9141," These 
discussions address both the reasonableness of the single-entity 
financial statements and specific significant issues at the subsid-
iaries",,,,,,,,,,
9142," Alongside reasonableness reviews, control mechanisms 
applied during the preparation of the single-entity and consolidated 
financial statements of Volkswagen AG include the clear delineation 
of areas of responsibility and the application of the dual control 
principle",,,,,,,,,,
9143," 
The Group management report is prepared – in accordance 
with the applicable requirements and regulations – centrally but 
with the involvement of and in consultation with the Group units 
and companies",,,,,,,,,,
9144," 
In addition, the accounting-related internal control system is 
independently reviewed by Group Internal Audit in Germany and 
abroad",,,,,,,,,,
9145," 
 
Integrated consolidation and planning system 
The Volkswagen consolidation and corporate management system 
(VoKUs) enables the Volkswagen Group to consolidate and analyze 
both Financial Reporting’s backward-looking data and Con-
trolling’s budget data",,,,,,,,,,
9146," VoKUs offers centralized master data 
management, uniform reporting, an authorization concept and 
maximum flexibility with regard to changes to the legal environ-
ment, providing a future-proof technical platform that benefits 
Group Financial Reporting and Group Controlling in equal 
measure",,,,,,,,,,
9147," To verify data consistency, VoKUs has a multi-level 
validation system that primarily checks content plausibility between 
the balance sheet, the income statement and the notes",,,,,,,,,,
9148,"  
 
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
In this section, we outline the risks and opportunities that arise in 
the course of our business activities",,,,,,,,,,
9149," We have grouped them into 
categories",,,,,,,,,,
9150," Unless explicitly mentioned, there were no material 
changes to the specific risks and opportunities compared with the 
previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9151,"  
The emissions issue gives rise to additional risks for the 
Volkswagen Group and also has an impact on existing risks",,,,,,,,,,
9152," These 
are described under the respective risk category",,,,,,,,,,
9153," 
We use competitive and environmental analyses and market 
studies to identify not only risks but also opportunities with a 
  positive impact on the design of our products, the efficiency with 
which they are produced, their success in the market and our cost 
structure",,,,,,,,,,
9154," Where they can be assessed, risks and opportunities that 
we expect to occur are already reflected in our medium-term 
planning and our forecast",,,,,,,,,,
9155," The following therefore reports on 
internal and external developments as risks and opportunities that 
may result in a negative or positive deviation from our forecast",,,,,,,,,,
9156," 
  Risks from the emissions issue 
In 2015, the Volkswagen Group recognized provisions arising from 
the emissions issue, in particular for the upcoming service 
campaigns, recalls and customer-related measures, but also for 
residual value risks",,,,,,,,,,
9157,"  
Due to existing estimation risks particularly from legal risks, 
criminal and administrative proceedings, higher expenses for 
technical solutions, lower market prices, repurchase obligations 
and customer-related measures, further significant financial lia-
bilities may emerge",,,,,,,,,,
9158," Demand may decrease – possibly exacerbated by 
a loss of reputation or insufficient communication",,,,,,,,,,
9159," Other potential 
consequences include lower margins in the new and used car 
businesses and a temporary increase in funds tied up in working 
capital",,,,,,,,,,
9160,"  
The funding needed to cover the risks may lead to assets having 
to be sold due to the situation and equivalent proceeds for them not 
being achieved as a result",,,,,,,,,,
9161,"  
Our ability to use refinancing instruments may possibly be 
restricted in the future or precluded for existing instruments due to 
the current uncertainties regarding the effects of the emissions 
issue on the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
9162," A downgrade of the Company’s 
rating could also adversely affect the terms associated with the 
Volkswagen Group’s borrowings",,,,,,,,,,
9163,"  
We are cooperating with all the responsible authorities to 
clarify these matters completely and transparently",,,,,,,,,,
9164," 
Macroeconomic risks and opportunities 
We believe that the risks to continued global economic growth lie 
primarily in turbulence in the financial markets and structural 
deficits, which pose a threat to the performance of some 
industrialized nations and emerging economies",,,,,,,,,,
9165," In the southern 
part of the eurozone, a sustained economic recovery is being 
hindered by the situation of some financial institutions whose 
ability to withstand a crisis is still not assured",,,,,,,,,,
9166," Persistently high 
private- and public-sector debt in many places is also clouding the 
outlook for growth and may cause markets to respond negatively",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
174  Declines in growth in key countries and regions often have an 
immediate impact on the state of the global economy and therefore 
pose a central risk",,,,,,,,,,
9169,"  
The economic development of some emerging economies is 
being hampered primarily by dependence on energy and commodity 
prices, capital inflows and socio-political tensions",,,,,,,,,,
9170," Corruption, 
inadequate government structures and a lack of legal certainty also 
pose risks",,,,,,,,,,
9171," 
Geopolitical tensions and conflicts are a further major risk to 
the performance of individual economies and regions",,,,,,,,,,
9172," As the global 
economy becomes increasingly interconnected, it is also vulnerable 
to local developments",,,,,,,,,,
9173," Any increasing escalation of the conflicts in 
Eastern Europe, the Middle East or Africa, for example, could cause 
further upheaval on the global energy and commodity markets and 
exacerbate migration trends",,,,,,,,,,
9174," The same goes for armed conflicts, 
terrorist activities, or the spread of infectious diseases, which may 
prompt unexpected, short-term responses from the markets",,,,,,,,,,
9175," 
Overall, we consider the probability of a global recession to be 
low",,,,,,,,,,
9176," Due to the risk factors mentioned, however, the possibility of a 
decline in global economic growth or a period of below-average 
growth rates cannot be ruled out",,,,,,,,,,
9177," 
The macroeconomic environment may also give rise to oppor-
tunities for the Volkswagen Group if actual developments differ in a 
positive way from expected developments",,,,,,,,,,
9178,"  
Sector-specific risk and market opportunities 
The growth markets of Asia, South America, and Central and 
Eastern Europe are particularly important to the Volkswagen Group 
in terms of the global trend in demand for passenger cars and 
commercial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
9179," Although these markets harbor considerable 
potential, the underlying conditions in some of the countries in 
these regions make it difficult to increase unit sales figures there",,,,,,,,,,
9180," 
Some have high customs barriers or minimum local content 
requirements for domestic production, for example",,,,,,,,,,
9181," The market 
development in Russia was again inhibited by the political crisis 
and its economic consequences in fiscal year 2015",,,,,,,,,,
9182," In South 
America, structural deficits continued to have a negative impact",,,,,,,,,,
9183," 
Restrictions on vehicle registrations could enter into force in 
further Chinese metropolitan areas in the future",,,,,,,,,,
9184," Additionally, a 
global economic slowdown could negatively impact consumer 
confidence",,,,,,,,,,
9185," Furthermore, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility 
of freight deliveries being shifted from trucks to other means of 
transport and of demand for the Group’s commercial vehicles 
falling as a result",,,,,,,,,,
9186," 
At the same time, if the economic and regulatory situation 
permits, there are opportunities for faster growth above and 
beyond current projections in emerging markets where vehicle 
densities are still low",,,,,,,,,,
9187," The demand that built up in some established 
markets during the crisis could also bring a more marked recovery 
in these markets if the economic environment eases more quickly 
than expected",,,,,,,,,,
9188," Price pressure in established automotive markets due to high 
market saturation is a particular challenge for the Volkswagen 
Group as a supplier of volume and premium models",,,,,,,,,,
9189," As the global 
economy is still under strain, competitive pressures are likely to 
remain high in the future",,,,,,,,,,
9190," Some manufacturers may respond by 
offering incentives in order to meet their sales targets, putting the 
entire sector under additional pressure, particularly in Western 
Europe, the  USA and China",,,,,,,,,,
9191," 
Western Europe is one of our main sales markets",,,,,,,,,,
9192," A drop in 
prices due to the economic climate triggered by falling demand in 
this region would have a particularly strong impact on the Com-
pany’s earnings",,,,,,,,,,
9193," We counter this risk with a clear, customer-
oriented and innovative product and pricing policy",,,,,,,,,,
9194," Outside 
Western Europe, delivery volumes are widely spread around the 
world; the Chinese market accounts for a large share",,,,,,,,,,
9195," We either 
already have a strong presence in numerous existing and 
developing markets or are working hard to build such a presence",,,,,,,,,,
9196," 
Moreover, strategic partnerships help us to increase our presence 
in these countries and regions and cater to requirements there",,,,,,,,,,
9197," 
In fiscal year 2015, economic trends varied considerably from 
region to region: whereas the situation in Western Europe continued 
to stabilize, the growth trend in China developed at a weaker pace",,,,,,,,,,
9198," 
The US economy expanded solidly, but market conditions in 
Eastern Europe and South America remained under strain",,,,,,,,,,
9199," The 
resulting challenges for our trading and sales companies, such as 
efficient inventory management and a profitable dealer network, 
are considerable and are being met by appropriate measures on 
their part",,,,,,,,,,
9200," However, financing business activities through bank 
loans remains difficult",,,,,,,,,,
9201," Our financial services companies offer 
dealers financing on attractive terms with the aim of strengthening 
their business models and reducing operational risk",,,,,,,,,,
9202," We have 
installed a comprehensive liquidity risk management system so that 
we can promptly counteract any liquidity bottlenecks at the dealers’ 
end that could hinder smooth business operations",,,,,,,,,,
9203,"  
We continue to approve loans for vehicle finance on the basis of 
the same cautious principles applied in the past, taking into account 
the regulatory requirements of section 25a(1) of the Kreditwesen-
gesetz (
KWG – German Banking Act)",,,,,,,,,,
9204,"  
Volkswagen may be exposed to increased competition in after-
markets for two reasons in particular: firstly, because of the pro-
visions of the block exemption regulations, which have been in 
force for after-sales service since June 2010, and, secondly, 
because of the amendments included in EU Regulation 566/2011 of 
June 8, 2011, which expand independent market participants’ 
access to technical information",,,,,,,,,,
9205," 
In addition, the European Commission is currently evaluating 
the market with regard to existing design protection",,,,,,,,,,

176  Even minor changes in growth or growth forecasts, resulting from 
geopolitical uncertainties or volatile commodities and foreign 
exchange markets, for example, can lead to significant changes in 
demand or the cancellation of existing orders",,,,,,,,,,
9253," We counter the 
considerable economic risks with, for example, flexible production 
concepts and cost flexibility, utilizing temporary employment, 
working time accounts and short-time work as well as potential 
structural adjustments",,,,,,,,,,
9254," The latter may possibly entail substantial 
one-time expenses",,,,,,,,,,
9255,"  
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RISK 
We conduct extensive trend analyses, customer surveys and 
scouting activities so as to reflect our customers’ requirements 
during product development as well as possible",,,,,,,,,,
9256," This way we ensure 
that we identify trends at an early stage and examine their relevance 
for our customers in good time",,,,,,,,,,
9257,"  
We counter the risk that it may not be possible to develop pro-
ducts or modules within the specified timeframe, to the required 
quality standards, or in line with cost specifications by continuously 
and systematically monitoring the progress of all projects and 
increasingly analyzing third-party industrial property rights, 
including in relation to communication technologies",,,,,,,,,,
9258," We regularly 
compare this progress with the project’s original targets; in the 
event of variances, we introduce appropriate countermeasures in 
good time",,,,,,,,,,
9259," Our end-to-end project organization supports effective 
cooperation among all areas involved in the process, ensuring that 
specific requirements are incorporated into the development 
process as early as possible and that their implementation is 
planned in good time",,,,,,,,,,
9260," 
 
Opportunities arising from the Modular Transverse Toolkit 
The Modular Transverse Toolkit  (MQB) and the Modular Produc-
tion Toolkit 
(MPB) enable us to cut both development costs and the 
necessary one-time expenses and manufacturing times, as well as 
making usage possible over several vehicle generations",,,,,,,,,,
9261," The 
toolkits also allow us to produce different models from different 
brands in various quantities, using the same system in a single plant",,,,,,,,,,
9262," 
This means that our capacities can be used with greater flexibility 
throughout the entire Group, enabling us to achieve efficiency gains",,,,,,,,,,
9263,"  
In addition to conventional petrol and diesel engines, the 
MQB 
also affords us the opportunity to integrate alternative drivetrains, 
such as natural gas, hybrid, or electric drives",,,,,,,,,,
9264," Previously, individual, 
vehicle-specific adaptations were necessary for each model",,,,,,,,,,
9265," The 
MQB has created an extremely flexible vehicle architecture that 
permits dimensions determined by the concept – such as the 
wheelbase, track width, wheel size and seat position – to be 
harmonized throughout the Group and utilized flexibly",,,,,,,,,,
9266," Other 
dimensions, for example the distance between the pedals and the 
middle of the front wheels, are always the same and ensure a 
uniform system in the front of the car, enabling synergies to be 
achieved",,,,,,,,,,
9267,"   Procurement risks and opportunities 
The procurement risk management system continuously and 
globally monitors the financial situation of our suppliers and takes 
targeted measures to avoid supply bottlenecks",,,,,,,,,,
9268," 
Economic recovery in Europe has contributed to the further 
stabilization of our supply base at an overall good level of capacity 
utilization and good margin situation",,,,,,,,,,
9269," Large and innovative 
suppliers in particular have benefited from this",,,,,,,,,,
9270," However, there has 
been an increase in the number of insolvencies globally due to 
highly volatile individual markets",,,,,,,,,,
9271," The unfavorable economic 
developments in South America and Russia in 2015 led to capacity 
adjustments by suppliers and, in some cases, to demands for higher 
prices",,,,,,,,,,
9272," At the same time, there was consolidation in the market",,,,,,,,,,
9273,"  
In China, the lower economic growth and increasing com-
petition led to a consolidation of the supplier base",,,,,,,,,,
9274," We are therefore 
now also looking more closely at suppliers in this region from the 
point of view of preventive risk management",,,,,,,,,,
9275,"  
The trend in procurement is to bundle contracts to a greater 
extent and to ensure worldwide availability of uniform components",,,,,,,,,,
9276," 
This is resulting in an increased need for financing and further 
consolidation in the supply industry",,,,,,,,,,
9277," The Volkswagen Group’s pro-
curement risk management system therefore assesses suppliers 
before they are commissioned to perform projects",,,,,,,,,,
9278," Among other 
things, the procurement function considers the risk of there being 
insufficient competition if it concentrates on a few financially 
strong suppliers when awarding contracts",,,,,,,,,,
9279," Quality problems may 
necessitate technical measures involving a considerable financial 
outlay where costs cannot be passed on to the supplier or can only 
be passed on to a limited extent",,,,,,,,,,
9280," In addition to financial difficulties, 
supply risks may, for example, arise as a result of fires or accidents 
at suppliers",,,,,,,,,,
9281," The supplier risks are automatically identified without 
delay in the procurement function through early warning systems 
and mitigated immediately by applying inferred measures",,,,,,,,,,
9282," 
Our modular toolkit strategy enables us to bundle volumes of 
vehicle parts and harmonize and synchronize requests for pro-
posals and procurement processes",,,,,,,,,,
9283," We systematically enhanced 
this strategy in the A0 vehicle class, which allowed us to consolidate 
worldwide volumes into a single global request",,,,,,,,,,
9284," In the process, we 
consider regional market requirements with the aim of maximizing 
customer satisfaction",,,,,,,,,,
9285," This enables us to exploit transregional 
synergies while at the same time minimizing start-up risks within 
the Volkswagen Group, one-time expenses and internal process 
costs",,,,,,,,,,

Optimum use of the possibilities of a worldwide procurement 
system is a central theme of the Group initiative “Future Automotive

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
177 Production risk 
Developments on the global automotive markets, the train strikes in 
Germany, fires at suppliers and storms, as well as the emissions 
issue towards the end of 2015, caused production volumes of 
several vehicle models to fluctuate at some plants",,,,,,,,,,
9290," We address such 
fluctuations using a variety of tried-and-tested tools, such as flexible 
working time models",,,,,,,,,,
9291," The technical design of the production 
network enables us to respond dynamically to changes in demand at 
the sites",,,,,,,,,,
9292," “Turntable concepts” even out capacity utilization between 
production facilities",,,,,,,,,,
9293," At multibrand sites, the number of which is 
growing in the Group, volatile demand can also be smoothed across 
brands",,,,,,,,,,
9294," 
Short-term fluctuations in customer demand for specific equip-
ment features in our products and the decreasing predictability of 
demand may lead to supply bottlenecks",,,,,,,,,,
9295," We minimize this risk, 
among other things, by continuously comparing our available 
resources against different future demand scenarios",,,,,,,,,,
9296," If we identify 
potential bottlenecks in the supply of materials, we can introduce 
countermeasures far enough in advance",,,,,,,,,,
9297," 
Production capacity is planned several years in advance for 
each vehicle project on the basis of expected sales trends",,,,,,,,,,
9298," These are 
subject to market changes and generally entail a degree of uncer-
tainty",,,,,,,,,,
9299," If forecasts are too optimistic, there is a risk that capacity will 
not be fully utilized",,,,,,,,,,
9300," Forecasts that are too pessimistic pose a risk of 
undercapacity, as a result of which it may not be possible to meet 
customer demand",,,,,,,,,,
9301," 
Events beyond our control such as natural disasters or other 
events, for example fires, explosions or the leakage of substances 
hazardous to health and/or the environment, may adversely affect 
production to a significant extent",,,,,,,,,,
9302," As a consequence, bottlenecks or 
even outages may occur, thus preventing the planned volume of 
production from being achieved",,,,,,,,,,
9303," We address such risks with, 
among other things, fire protection measures and hazardous goods 
management and cover them – where financially viable – using 
insurance",,,,,,,,,,
9304,"  
The range of our models is growing, while at the same time 
product lifecycles are becoming shorter; the number of new vehicle 
start-ups at our sites worldwide is therefore increasing",,,,,,,,,,
9305," The 
processes and technical systems we use for this are complex and 
there is thus a risk that vehicle deliveries may be delayed",,,,,,,,,,
9306," We 
address this risk by drawing on experience of past start-ups and, 
identifying weaknesses at an early stage, so as to ensure that 
production volumes and quality standards are met during our new 
vehicle start-ups throughout the Group",,,,,,,,,,
9307," In order to prevent downtime in general, lost output, rejects and 
reworking, we use the  TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) method 
at our production facilities",,,,,,,,,,
9308," 
TPM is a continuous process involving 
the entire workforce",,,,,,,,,,
9309," Round-the-clock maintenance of the 
technical facilities means that they are always operational and 
guaranteed to function reliably",,,,,,,,,,
9310," 
 
Risks arising from long-term production 
In the case of large projects, risks may arise that are often only 
identified in the course of the project",,,,,,,,,,
9311," They may result in particular 
from contract drafting errors, miscosting, post-contract changes in 
economic and technical conditions, weaknesses in project man-
agement, or poor performance by subcontractors",,,,,,,,,,
9312," In particular, 
omissions or errors made at the start of a project are usually difficult 
to compensate for or correct and often entail substantial additional 
expenses",,,,,,,,,,
9313,"  
We endeavor to identify these risks at an even earlier stage and 
to take appropriate measures to eliminate or minimize them before 
they occur by constantly optimizing the project control process 
across all project phases and by using lessons learned process and 
regular project reviews",,,,,,,,,,
9314," We can thus further reduce risk, partic-
ularly during the bidding and planning phase for large upcoming 
projects",,,,,,,,,,
9315,"  
 
Risks arising from changes in demand 
As a result of the emissions issue – possibly exacerbated by media 
reports – the Volkswagen Group may possibly experience decreases 
in demand",,,,,,,,,,
9316," When dealing with the issue, our highest priority is to 
provide customers with solutions, both from a technical perspective 
and in financial matters",,,,,,,,,,
9317," In addition, we are pressing ahead with 
the systematic clarification of the misconduct in the Company",,,,,,,,,,
9318," 
Consumer demand is shaped not only by real factors such as 
disposable income, but also by psychological factors that cannot be 
planned for",,,,,,,,,,
9319," Unexpected buyer reluctance, possibly further 
exacerbated by media reports, could stem from households’ 
worries about the future economic situation, for example",,,,,,,,,,
9320," This is 
particularly the case in saturated automotive markets such as 
Western Europe, where demand could drop as a result of owners 
holding on to their vehicles for longer",,,,,,,,,,
9321," In the reporting period, it 
became evident that the effects of the eurozone debt crisis have not 
yet been overcome",,,,,,,,,,
9322," Several automotive markets, particularly in 
Southern Europe, were able to further recover from their record 
lows, however, and exhibited positive growth rates",,,,,,,,,,
9323," We are 
countering this buyer reluctance with our attractive range of models 
and systematic customer orientation",,,,,,,,,,
9324,"  
  ",,,,,,,,,,
9325," 
  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
178  A combination of buyer reluctance as a result of the crisis and 
increases in some vehicle taxes based on CO
2 emissions – as is 
already the case in some European countries – is driving a shift in 
demand towards smaller segments and engines in individual 
markets",,,,,,,,,,
9326," We counter the risk that such a shift will negatively impact 
the Volkswagen Group’s earnings by constantly developing new, 
fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative drive technologies, based on 
our drivetrain and fuel strategy",,,,,,,,,,
9327," Automotive markets around the 
world are exposed to risks from government intervention such as 
tax increases, which curb private consumption",,,,,,,,,,
9328,"  
Commercial vehicles are capital goods: in an economic upturn, 
the need for transport and thus the demand rises sharply, whereas 
in economically difficult times demand falls just as sharply",,,,,,,,,,
9329," The 
production fluctuations arising as a result require a high degree of 
flexibility from manufacturers",,,,,,,,,,
9330," Although production volumes are 
significantly lower, the complexity of the trucks and buses range in 
fact significantly exceeds the already very high complexity of the 
passenger cars’ range",,,,,,,,,,
9331," The priorities for commercial vehicle cus-
tomers are overall running costs, vehicle reliability and the service 
provided",,,,,,,,,,
9332,"  
MAN Power Engineering’s two-stroke engines are produced 
exclusively by licensees, particularly in Korea, China and Japan",,,,,,,,,,
9333," 
Due to volatile demand in new ship construction and heavy invest-
ment by some licensees, there is excess capacity in the market for 
marine engines, resulting in risks ranging from a decline in license 
revenues through to bad debt losses",,,,,,,,,,
9334," There is also a risk that market 
share will be lost as a result of Chinese state-owned licensees 
merging with competitors",,,,,,,,,,
9335," We address these risks by constantly 
monitoring the markets, working closely together with licensees 
and carefully managing business relationships with them",,,,,,,,,,
9336," This also 
includes receivables management in order to safeguard our license 
revenues",,,,,,,,,,
9337," 
 
Dependence on fleet customer business  
The percentage of total registrations in Germany accounted for by 
fleet customers rose to 14",,,,,,,,,,
9338,1 (13,,,,,,,,,,
9339,3)% in fiscal year 2015,,,,,,,,,,

Volkswagen Group’s share of this customer segment rose to 
48",,,,,,,,,,
9341,5 (48,,,,,,,,,,
9342,4)%,,,,,,,,,,
9343," Registrations by fleet customers in Europe were  
11",,,,,,,,,,

of this was 28",,,,,,,,,,
9345,9 (29,,,,,,,,,,
9346,2)%,,,,,,,,,,
9347,"  
The fleet customer business is generally more stable than the 
business with retail customers",,,,,,,,,,
9348," In light of the emissions issue, many 
fleet customers reacted with concern",,,,,,,,,,
9349," There was, however, no 
reported impact on new vehicle registrations in fleet customer busi-
ness in 2015",,,,,,,,,,
9350," With clarification of the CO
2 issue and the technical 
solutions within the scope of the diesel issue, we also expect no 
significant volume decreases for the fleet customer business of the 
Volkswagen Group in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9351," The fleet customer business continues to be characterized by 
increasing concentration and internationalization",,,,,,,,,,
9352," The Volkswagen 
Group is well positioned with its broad portfolio of products and 
drive systems, as well as its target-group-focused customer care",,,,,,,,,,
9353," 
There is no concentration of default risks at individual fleet cus-
tomers",,,,,,,,,,
9354,"  
  Quality risk 
Right from the product development stage, we aim to identify and 
rectify quality problems at the earliest possible point, so as to avoid 
delays to the start of production",,,,,,,,,,
9355," As we are using an increasing 
number of modular components as part of our modular toolkit 
strategy, it is very important when defects do occur to identify and 
eliminate the cause of the defect as quickly as possible",,,,,,,,,,
9356," We further 
optimized the processes with which we can prevent these 
procedural defects at our brands and improved our organizational 
processes during the reporting period so that we are able to counter 
the associated risks more effectively",,,,,,,,,,
9357," 
Increasing technical complexity and the use of the toolkit 
system in the Group mean that the need for high-grade supplier 
components of impeccable quality is rising",,,,,,,,,,
9358," To ensure the 
continuity of production, it is also extremely important that our own 
plants and our suppliers deliver components on time",,,,,,,,,,
9359," We ensure 
long-term quality and supply capability from the very start of the 
supply chain using a risk management system that we first tested 
internally and then introduced among suppliers",,,,,,,,,,
9360," In this way, Quality 
Assurance helps to fulfill customer expectations and consequently 
to boost our Company’s reputation, sales figures and earnings",,,,,,,,,,
9361," 
Assuring quality is of fundamental importance especially in the 
Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese markets, for which we 
develop dedicated vehicles and where local manufacturers and 
suppliers have been established, particularly as it may be very 
difficult to estimate regulatory or official decisions",,,,,,,,,,
9362," We continuously 
analyze the conditions specific to each market and adapt quality 
requirements to them",,,,,,,,,,
9363," We counter the local risks we identify by 
continuously developing promising measures and implementing 
them locally, thereby effectively preventing quality defects from 
arising",,,,,,,,,,
9364,"  
Vehicle registration and operation criteria are defined and 
monitored by national and, in some cases, international authorities",,,,,,,,,,
9365," 
Some countries also have special, and in some cases new, rules 
aimed at protecting customers in their dealings with vehicle 
manufacturers",,,,,,,,,,
9366," With our established and revised quality assurance 
processes, we ensure that the Volkswagen Group brands and their 
products fulfill all applicable requirements and that local 
authorities receive timely notification of all issues requiring 
reporting",,,,,,,,,,
9367," By doing so, we reduce the risk of customer complaints, 
administrative fines and other negative consequences",,,,,,,,,,

Report on Risks and Opportunities  
179 Personnel Risk 
We counter economic risks as well as changes in the market and 
competitive situation with a range of instruments that help the 
Group to remain flexible, even with fluctuating order intake  
– whether orders decline or demand for our products increases",,,,,,,,,,
9370," 
These include time accounts which are filled when overtime is 
necessary and reduced through time off in quiet periods, enabling 
our factories to adjust their capacity to the production volume and to 
“breathe” with measures such as extra shifts, closure days and 
flexible shift models",,,,,,,,,,
9371," The use of temporary workers also allows us to 
plan more flexibly",,,,,,,,,,
9372," All of these measures help the Volkswagen 
Group to maintain a stable permanent workforce as a rule even 
when orders fluctuate",,,,,,,,,,
9373,"  
The technical expertise and individual commitment of employees 
are essential prerequisites for the success of the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,

Our strategic, end-to-end human resources development strategy 
gives all employees attractive training and development oppor-
tunities, with particular emphasis being placed on increasing 
technical expertise in the Company’s different vocational groups",,,,,,,,,,
9375," 
By boosting our training programs, particularly at our international 
locations, we are able to adequately address the challenges of tech-
nological change",,,,,,,,,,

us to make contact with talented candidates from strategically 
relevant target groups at an early stage and to build a long-term 
relationship between them and the Group",,,,,,,,,,
9378,"  
In addition to the standard dual vocational training, programs 
such as our StIP integrated degree and traineeship scheme ensure 
a pipeline of highly qualified and motivated employees",,,,,,,,,,
9379," We counter 
the risk that knowledge will be lost as a result of employee fluc-
tuation and retirement with intensive, department-specific training",,,,,,,,,,
9380,"

the Group",,,,,,,,,,
9381," With this additional measure we use the valuable 
knowledge of our experienced specialists that retired from 
Volkswagen",,,,,,,,,,

IT Risk 
At Volkswagen, a global company geared towards further growth, 
the information technology (IT) used in all divisions Group-wide is 
assuming an increasingly important role",,,,,,,,,,
9383," IT risks include unautho-
rized access to sensitive electronic corporate data as well as limited 
systems availability as a consequence of downtime or natural 
disasters",,,,,,,,,,
9384,"  
We address the risk of unauthorized access to corporate data 
with IT security technologies (e",,,,,,,,,,

One of our focuses is on continuously enhancing our security 
measures",,,,,,,,,,
9391," The current IT security program, for example, is built on 
structured rights management, optimization of IT infrastructure, 
application security and the IT security command center",,,,,,,,,,

DCSO conducts security 
audits and certifies key suppliers and technologies in order to help 
German businesses detect and defend against cyber-attacks and to 
predict them in future",,,,,,,,,,
9398," It is hoped that close exchange of infor-
mation with the Federal Ministry of the Interior and the Federal 
Office for Information Security will aid the compilation of an 
anonymized status report on national cybersecurity",,,,,,,,,,
9399," Small and 
medium-sized enterprises – including many of our suppliers – can 
obtain security services offered by 
DCSO, which they would 
otherwise be unable to afford",,,,,,,,,,
9400," Volkswagen also benefits from this, 
as it makes our supply chain more secure",,,,,,,,,,

industry, for example",,,,,,,,,,
9443," Vehicle taxes based on CO
2 emissions are 
having a similar steering effect; many EU member states have 
already incorporated CO
2 elements into their rules on vehicle 
taxation",,,,,,,,,,
9444," 
Heavy commercial vehicles first put into operation from 2014 
onwards are already subject to the stricter emission requirements 
under the Euro 6 standard in accordance with EU Regulation No 
582/2011",,,,,,,,,,
9445," The EU is also preparing a further CO
2 regulation for 
heavy commercial vehicles at the same time as the CO
2 legislation 
for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
9446," Simply setting an 
overarching limit for these vehicles – like that in place for pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles – is just one option for 
these vehicles and would require an extremely complex set of rules 
because of the wide range of variants",,,,,,,,,,
9447," With the support of 
independent scientific institutions and the European Automobile 
Manufacturers’ Association 
(ACEA), the European Commission is 
currently preparing a simulation-based method called 
VECTO

Probably starting 2018 (2019 at the latest), a CO
2 declaration is 
expected to be compulsory for selected vehicle categories (initially 
long-haul and regional distribution vehicles, later also buses and 
other segments), with the captured data initially being used for 
customer information allowing comparability, for certification and 
for monitoring purposes",,,,,,,,,,
9451," Further vehicle categories are likely to be 
included as time progresses",,,,,,,,,,
9452," 
Manufacturers of heavy commercial vehicles are urging the 
adoption of a system for quantifying CO
2 figures that is accessible to 
everyone and that looks at the vehicle as a whole and not simply at 
the engine or the tractor, but also at the trailers and bodywork",,,,,,,,,,

2 emissions of heavy com-
mercial vehicles, the European Commission has also adjusted the 
provisions regarding the maximum permissible dimensions and 
weights of trucks (Directive 1996/53/EC, the Weights and Dimen-
sions Directive) and revised them through EU Directive 2015/719",,,,,,,,,,
9455," 
As a consequence, cabs with a rounded shape and aerodynamic 
devices at the rear of the vehicle will enable future improvements in 
aerodynamics",,,,,,,,,,

extended by increasing the length of the cab in  
  order to improve safety",,,,,,,,,,

overall weight permitted for vehicles with alternative drive 
technologies by up to one tonne",,,,,,,,,,

it is not just new vehicles that matter for future CO
2 emissions; 
individual components are also important, such as reduced rolling 
resistance tires and the aerodynamic trim of the trailer, as are 
driving behavior, alternative fuels, transport infrastructure and 
transport conditions",,,,,,,,,,
9461," Longer, heavier vehicles that can decrease 
fuel consumption and thus CO
2 emissions by up to 25% according 
to scientific studies by the Federal Highway Research Institute are 
currently also driving on German roads in a field trial",,,,,,,,,,

for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (
MARPOL – MARine 
POLlution), with which limits on emissions from marine engines 
will be reduced in phases",,,,,,,,,,

In 2013, the European Commission decided to initially with-
hold a portion of the certificates to be auctioned and to only release 
them for auction at a later date during the third trading period 
(backloading)",,,,,,,,,,
9481," This temporary scarcity of certificates, which could 
lead to a price increase, will be directed into a market stability 
reserve, to be established in 2018",,,,,,,,,,

correct any imbalance between the supply of and demand for 
certificates in emissions trading",,,,,,,,,,

advertised clean diesels and that customers were misled into 
purchasing Volkswagen diesel vehicles as a result",,,,,,,,,,

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also made similar accusations 
against the Volkswagen Group of America in its lawsuit from  
March 29, 2016",,,,,,,,,,

In addition to lawsuits described above, for which provisions 
have been recognized, a number of lawsuits for damages have been

9604," Risk assessment regarding the diesel issue 
To protect against the currently known legal risks, including 
suitable expenses for defense and legal advice related to the diesel 
issue, existing information and assessments at the time indicated 
the need to generate provisions in the amount of €7",,,,,,,,,,
9605,0 billion,,,,,,,,,,
9606," A sum 
amounting to €1 billion has also been reported for contingent 
liabilities, insofar as these can be adequately measured at this stage",,,,,,,,,,
9607," 
The provisions recognized, the contingent liabilities disclosed and 
the other latent legal risks are partially subject to substantial 
estimation risks given the complexity of the individual factors, the 
ongoing regulatory approval process with the authorities and the 
fact that the independent and exhaustive investigations have not yet 
been completed",,,,,,,,,,
9608," In addition, negotiations are currently being 
conducted with the authorities in the USA concerning possible

action against Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Stuttgart, Germany, 
and Volkswagen AG for claims for damages allegedly assigned to it 
in the amount of approximately €2",,,,,,,,,,
9613,26 billion,,,,,,,,,,
9614," The plaintiff asserts 
that these claims are based on alleged breaches by the defendants 
of legislation to protect the capital markets in connection with 
Porsche’s acquisition of Volkswagen shares in 2008",,,,,,,,,,
9615," With its April 
2016 ruling, the district court of Hannover submitted numerous 
goals for discovery to the higher regional court in Celle in an 
attempt to prompt a model case decision",,,,,,,,,,
9616," In all other cases, the 
claims were thrown out for being inadmissible",,,,,,,,,,
9617," In various cases 
since 2010, investors initiated conciliation proceedings for other 
alleged damages – including claims against Volkswagen AG – that 
amounted to approximately €4",,,,,,,,,,
9618,"6 billion in total and also related to 
transactions at that time",,,,,,,,,,
9619," In each case, Volkswagen rejected the 
claims asserted and refused to participate in any conciliation 
proceedings",,,,,,,,,,
9620," 
In 2011, the European Commission opened antitrust pro-
ceedings against European truck manufacturers including 
MAN 
and Scania",,,,,,,,,,
9621," In November 2014, the European Commission sent a 
statement of objections to 
MAN, Scania and the other truck manu-
facturers concerned, in which it informed the truck manufacturers 
of the objections raised against them and gave them the right to 
comment extensively on the objections raised and to exercise other 
rights of defense before any decision is reached",,,,,,,,,,
9622," Given the fact that 
the issues are still being clarified, it is too early to judge whether the 
European Commission’s investigation will result in financial 
  liabilities for  MAN and Scania and, if so, to assess their amount",,,,,,,,,,
9623," As a 
consequence, neither 
MAN nor Scania has recognized provisions or 
disclosed contingent liabilities",,,,,,,,,,
9624," 
The Annual General Meeting of 
MAN SE approved the con-
clusion of a control and profit and loss transfer agreement between 
MAN SE and Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH (formerly Truck & Bus 
GmbH), a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, in June 2013",,,,,,,,,,
9625," In July 2013, 
award proceedings were instituted to review the appropriateness of 
the cash settlement set out in the agreement in accordance with 
section 305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation 
Act) and the cash compensation in accordance with section 304 of 
the AktG",,,,,,,,,,
9626," It is not uncommon for noncontrolling interest share-
holders to institute such proceedings",,,,,,,,,,
9627," In July 2015, the Munich 
Regional Court ruled in the first instance that the amount of the 
cash settlement payable to the noncontrolling interest shareholders 
of 
MAN should be increased from €80",,,,,,,,,,
9628,89 to €90,,,,,,,,,,
9629,"29; at the same 
time, the amount of the cash compensation was confirmed",,,,,,,,,,
9630," Both 
applicants and Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH have appealed to the 
Higher Regional Court in Munich",,,,,,,,,,
9631," Volkswagen continues to main-
tain that the results of the valuation are correct",,,,,,,,,,

ness of the valuation was confirmed by the audit firms engaged by 
the parties and by the court-appointed auditor of the agreement",,,,,,,,,,

The assessment of liability for put options and compensation rights 
granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders was adjusted in 
turn",,,,,,,,,,

Strategies for hedging financial risks 
In the course of our business activities, financial risks may arise 
from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, raw materials prices, 
or share and fund prices",,,,,,,,,,
9638," Management of financial and liquidity 
risks is the responsibility of the central Group Treasury department, 
which minimizes these risks using nonderivative and derivative 
financial instruments",,,,,,,,,,
9639," The Board of Management is informed of 
the current risk situation at regular intervals",,,,,,,,,,
9640," 
We hedge interest rate risk – where appropriate in combination 
with currency risk – and risks arising from fluctuations in the value 
of financial instruments by means of interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps and other interest rate contracts with funda-
mentally matching amounts and maturities",,,,,,,,,,

currencies other than the respective functional currency",,,,,,,,,,
9649," The 
currency forwards and currency options can have a term of up to six 
years",,,,,,,,,,

and Goals of Financial Management” starting on page 113",,,,,,,,,,
9662," In 
addition to counterparty risk, the financial instruments held for 
hedging purposes hedge balance sheet risks, which we limit by 
applying hedge accounting",,,,,,,,,,

into financial instruments for hedging purposes, we ensure that the

solvent at all times, even in the event of a default by individual 
counterparties",,,,,,,,,,

187 Residual value risk in the financial services business 
In the financial services business, we agree to buy back selected 
vehicles at a residual value that is fixed at inception of the contract",,,,,,,,,,
9674," 
Residual values are set at a realistic amount so that we are able to 
leverage market opportunities",,,,,,,,,,
9675," We evaluate the underlying lease 
contracts at regular intervals and recognize any necessary pro-
visions if we identify any potential risks",,,,,,,,,,
9676," 
Management of the residual value risk is based on a defined 
feedback loop ensuring the full assessment, monitoring, manage-
ment and communication of risks",,,,,,,,,,
9677," This process design ensures not 
only professional management of residual risks but also that we 
systematically improve and enhance our handling of residual value 
risks",,,,,,,,,,
9678," 
As part of our risk management, we use residual value forecasts 
to regularly assess the appropriateness of the provisions for risks 
and the potential for residual value risk – also with a view to the 
emissions issue",,,,,,,,,,
9679," In the process, we compare the contractually 
agreed residual values with the fair values obtainable",,,,,,,,,,
9680," These are 
determined utilizing data from external service providers and our 
own marketing data",,,,,,,,,,
9681," We do not take account of the upside in 
residual market values when making provisions for risks",,,,,,,,,,

financial services business, such as counterparty, market and 
liquidity risk, can be found in the 2015 Annual Report of Volks-
wagen Financial Services AG",,,,,,,,,,

most important assets and forms the basis for long-term business 
success",,,,,,,,,,

the public focus",,,,,,,,,,

ness is therefore to pay particular attention to compliance with legal requirements and ethical principles",,,,,,,,,,
9686," However, we are aware that 
misconduct or criminal acts of individuals and the resulting 
reputational damage can never be fully prevented",,,,,,,,,,
9687," In addition, 
media reactions can have a negative effect on the reputation of the 
Volkswagen Group and its brands",,,,,,,,,,
9688," This impact could be amplified 
through insufficient communication",,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the above-described individual risks that may arise 
in the course of our operating activities may turn into a threat to the 
Volkswagen Group’s reputation",,,,,,,,,,
9690,"   Other factors 
Going beyond the risks already outlined, there are other factors that 
cannot be predicted and whose repercussions are therefore 
difficult to control",,,,,,,,,,

have put in place a comprehensive risk management system to 
ensure that these risks are controlled",,,,,,,,,,

the Group may result from a negative trend in unit sales of, and 
markets for, vehicles and genuine parts, from the failure to develop 
and produce products in line with demand and from quality 
problems",,,,,,,,,,
9696," Compared with the previous year, the emissions issue 
gives rise to additional risks for the Volkswagen Group which, when 
aggregated, are among the most significant risks",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Prospects for 2016 
188  The Volkswagen Group’s Board of Management expects the global 
economy to record the same level of growth in 2016 as in the 
previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9705," Risks will arise from turbulence in the financial 
markets and structural deficits in individual countries",,,,,,,,,,
9706," In addition, 
growth prospects continue to be hurt by geopolitical tensions and 
conflicts",,,,,,,,,,
9707," We expect the economic upturn to continue in most 
industrialized nations, with moderate rates of expansion overall",,,,,,,,,,
9708," As 
in the previous year, growth will in all probability be muted in many 
emerging markets",,,,,,,,,,
9709," We expect the strongest rates of expansion in 
Asia’s emerging economies",,,,,,,,,,
9710," 
We expect trends in the passenger car markets in the individual 
regions to be mixed in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9711," Overall, growth in global demand for 
new vehicles will probably be slower than in the reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
9712," 
We anticipate that the demand volume in Western Europe and the 
Germany passenger car market will be in line with the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9713," 
In the Central and Eastern European markets, demand for 
passenger cars is estimated to be under the weak prior-year figure",,,,,,,,,,
9714," 
In North America, we expect last year’s positive trend to continue at 
a slightly weaker pace",,,,,,,,,,
9715," The volumes of the South American markets 
will probably fall noticeably short of the prior-year figures",,,,,,,,,,
9716," The 
passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region look set to 
continue their growth path at a similar pace",,,,,,,,,,
9717," 
Global demand for light commercial vehicles will probably see a 
slight increase in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9718," We expect trends to vary from region to 
region",,,,,,,,,,
9719," 
In the markets for mid-sized and heavy trucks that are relevant 
for the Volkswagen Group, new registrations in 2016 are set to drop 
slightly below the prior-year level, while new registrations of buses 
in the relevant markets will probably be noticeably lower than in the 
previous year",,,,,,,,,,
9720," 
We expect automotive financial services to continue to grow in 
importance worldwide in 2016",,,,,,,,,,
9721,"  
The Volkswagen Group is well positioned to deal with the mixed 
developments in the global automotive markets",,,,,,,,,,
9722," Our broad, 
selectively expanded product range featuring the latest generation 
of engines as well as a variety of alternative drives puts us in a good 
position globally compared with our competitors",,,,,,,,,,
9723," The Group’s 
strengths include in particular its unique brand portfolio, its steadily growing presence in all major world markets and its wide 
selection of financial services",,,,,,,,,,
9724," Our range of models spans from 
motorcycles through compact, sports and luxury cars to heavy 
trucks and buses, and covers almost all segments",,,,,,,,,,
9725," The Volkswagen 
Group’s brands will press ahead with their product initiative in 
2016, modernizing and expanding their offering by introducing 
new models",,,,,,,,,,
9726," Our goal is to offer all customers the mobility and 
innovations they need, sustainably strengthening our competitive 
position in the process",,,,,,,,,,
9727," 
We expect that, on the whole, deliveries to customers of the 
Volkswagen Group in 2016 will be on a level with the previous year 
amid persistently challenging market conditions, with a growing 
volume in China",,,,,,,,,,
9728," 
In addition to the emissions issue, the highly competitive 
environment as well as interest rate and exchange rate volatility and 
fluctuations in raw materials prices all pose challenges",,,,,,,,,,
9729," We antici-
pate positive effects from the efficiency programs implemented by 
all brands and from the modular toolkits",,,,,,,,,,
9730," 
Depending on the economic conditions – particularly in South 
America and Russia – and the exchange rate development and in 
light of the emissions issue, we expect 2016 sales revenue for the 
Volkswagen Group to be down by as much as 5% on the prior-year 
figure",,,,,,,,,,

the operating return on sales will be between 5",,,,,,,,,,
9732,0% and 6,,,,,,,,,,
9733,"0% in 
2016",,,,,,,,,,

pated range of 5",,,,,,,,,,
9735,5 – 6,,,,,,,,,,
9736,5%,,,,,,,,,,
9737," With sales revenue in the Commercial

We expect sales revenue in the Power Engineering Business Area to 
be perceptibly lower than the prior-year figure, with a significantly 
reduced operating result",,,,,,,,,,

are forecasting sales revenue and operating result at the prior-year

that irregularities in relation to nitrogen oxide (NO
x) emissions had been discovered in emissions tests on certain vehicles 
with Volkswagen Group diesel engines",,,,,,,,,,
9899," It has been alleged that we had used undisclosed engine management software 
installed in certain four-cylinder diesel engines used in certain 2009 to 2015 model year vehicles to circumvent NO
x 
emissions testing regulations in the United States of America in order to comply with certification requirements",,,,,,,,,,
9900," The US 
environmental authority of California – the California Air Resources Board (
CARB) – announced its own enforcement 
investigation in this context",,,,,,,,,,
9901," Following these announcements by 
EPA and CARB, authorities in various other jurisdictions 
worldwide commenced their own investigations",,,,,,,,,,
9902," 
In its ad hoc release dated September 22, 2015, the Volkswagen Group announced that there were discrepancies in 
relation to NO
x emissions figures in vehicles with type EA 189 four-cylinder diesel engines",,,,,,,,,,
9903," Around eleven million vehicles 
worldwide were affected",,,,,,,,,,
9904, This is attributable to the engine management software,,,,,,,,,,
9905," The vehicles remain technically safe and 
ready to drive",,,,,,,,,,
9906," 
Technical solutions have been prepared for the three European variants of the type EA 189 engine affected",,,,,,,,,,
9907," These 
solutions have been approved in principle by the German Kraftfahrtbundesamt (German Federal Motor Transport 
Authority) for Volkswagen AG and 
AUDI AG",,,,,,,,,,
9908," The Group brands  SEAT and ŠKODA also received approvals in principle each 
from their respective type approval authorities – the Ministry of Industry in Spain and the Vehicle Certification Agency in 
the United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,
9909," 
In North America, three variants of certain four-cylinder diesel engines are affected",,,,,,,,,,
9910," Due to considerably stricter NO
x 
limits in the 
USA, it is a greater technical challenge to refit the vehicles so that all applicable emissions limits can be met",,,,,,,,,,
9911," 
Volkswagen is currently in intensive discussions with the 
EPA and CARB concerning remedial measures",,,,,,,,,,
9912," 
On November 2, 2015, the 
EPA issued another “Notice of Violation” alleging that irregularities had also been dis-
covered in the software installed in vehicles with type V6 3",,,,,,,,,,

9914," 
CARB also issued a letter announcing its own 
enforcement investigation in this context",,,,,,,,,,

After discussions with the 
EPA and CARB, Audi publicly announced on November 23, 2015 that it would revise the 
software parameters and resubmit them for approval in the

9930,9 billion of the expenses was recognized in distribution expenses and €7,,,,,,,,,,

9933," Please refer to the “Litigation” section for a discussion of the 
legal risks associated with the diesel issue",,,,,,,,,,
9934," The ongoing investigations mean that assessment of the circumstances is 
subject to estimation risk",,,,,,,,,,
9935," In particular, the estimates may experience considerable change as the technical measures in 
the 
USA and Canada take shape and the legal risks crystallize",,,,,,,,,,
9936," 
In addition, internal risk regulations required hedging transactions to be discontinued in this context",,,,,,,,,,
9937," In accordance 
with 
IAS 39",,,,,,,,,,
9938,"101(b), the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognized from the period when 
the hedge was effective remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs",,,,,,,,,,
9939," 
Based on current information, fiscal year 2014 is not affected by the effects of the diesel issue",,,,,,,,,,
9940," Even after the 
International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) study was published in May 2014, the discrepancies were initially 
regarded – on the basis of the facts currently known regarding the members of the Board of Management responsible at 
that time – as a technical problem that did not basically differ from other everyday technical problems at an automotive 
company",,,,,,,,,,
9941," In the exhaust measurements carried out in-house at Volkswagen in the subsequent months, the test set-ups on 
which the ICCT study was based were repeated and the unusually high NO
x emissions confirmed",,,,,,,,,,
9942," CARB was informed of 
this result, and at the same time the offer was made to recalibrate the type EA 189 diesel engines as part of a service 
measure that was already planned in the USA",,,,,,,,,,
9943," This measure was evaluated and adopted by the Ausschuss für Produkt-
sicherheit (APS – product safety committee), which includes, among others, employees from the technical development, 
quality assurance, sales, production, logistics, procurement and legal departments, as part of the existing processes within 
the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
9944, The APS thus plays a central role in the internal control system at Volkswagen AG,,,,,,,,,,
9945," There are 
currently no reliable findings to confirm that an unlawful software modification was reported by the APS as the cause of the 
discrepancies to the persons responsible for preparing the 2014 annual and consolidated financial statements",,,,,,,,,,
9946," Instead, at 
the time that the annual and consolidated financial statements were being prepared, this group of people remained under 
the impression that the discrepancies could be eliminated with comparatively little effort as a part of a field measure",,,,,,,,,,
9947," Based 
on what is currently known, the actual background of the discrepancies only became clear gradually to the members of the 
Board of Management dealing with the matter",,,,,,,,,,
9948," It was only reliably recognized in the summer of 2015 that the cause of the 
discrepancies was a software modification, to be qualified as a so-called ""defeat device"" as defined by US environmental 
law",,,,,,,,,,
9949," This culminated in the disclosure of the ""defeat device"" to the EPA/CARB on September 3, 2015",,,,,,,,,,
9950," According to the 
assessment at that time of the members of the Board of Management dealing with the matter, the scope of the costs 
expected as a result by the Volkswagen Group (recall costs, retrofitting costs and financial penalties), was basically not 
dissimilar to that of previous cases in which other vehicle manufacturers were involved, and therefore appeared to be 
controllable overall with a view to the business activities of the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
9951," This appraisal by Volkswagen AG was 
based on the assessment of a law firm brought in in the USA for approval issues, according to which similar cases in the 
past were resolved amicably with the US authorities",,,,,,,,,,
9952," Publication of a ""Notice of Violation"" by the EPA on September 18, 
2015, which came as a surprise to the company, on the facts and possible financial consequences, then presented the 
situation in a completely different light",,,,,,,,,,

influence those returns",,,,,,,,,,
9956," In the case of the structured entities consolidated in the Volkswagen Group, Volkswagen is able to 
direct the material relevant activities remaining after the change in the structure even if it is not invested in the structured 
entity concerned and is thus able to influence the variable returns from its involvement",,,,,,,,,,

primarily to enter into asset-backed securities transactions to refinance the financial services business and to invest sur-
plus liquidity in special securities funds",,,,,,,,,,

Significant companies where Volkswagen AG is able, directly or indirectly, to significantly influence financial and 
operating policy decisions (associates), or that are directly or indirectly jointly controlled (joint ventures), are accounted for 
using the equity method",,,,,,,,,,

207  CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  On March 14, 2014, Volkswagen AG published an offer to the shareholders of Scania Aktiebolag, Södertälje, (“Scania”) to 
acquire all Scania A and Scania B shares",,,,,,,,,,
9983," Each Scania A share conveys one vote at the general meeting, while each Scania B 
share conveys one-tenth of a vote",,,,,,,,,,
9984, There are no other legal differences between Scania A and B shares,,,,,,,,,,
9985," Volkswagen AG 
offered 
SEK 200 for each Scania share, regardless of share class",,,,,,,,,,
9986," One of the conditions of the offer was that it resulted in 
the Volkswagen Group holding more than 90 percent of the total number of Scania shares",,,,,,,,,,
9987," When the offer to the Scania 
shareholders was published, the present value of the put options granted amounting to approximately €6",,,,,,,,,,
9988,"7 billion was 
recognized as a current liability without affecting profit or loss",,,,,,,,,,
9989," The Group’s retained earnings declined by the same 
amount",,,,,,,,,,
9990," 
Starting on May 7, 2014, Volkswagen acquired a total of 2",,,,,,,,,,
9991,"4 million Scania shares outside the offer (10,941 A shares 
and 2,400,679 B shares)",,,,,,,,,,
9992, This corresponds to 0,,,,,,,,,,
9993,30% of Scania shares and 0,,,,,,,,,,
9994,06% of the voting rights,,,,,,,,,,
9995," 
The condition for the Volkswagen Group to hold more than 90% of the total number of Scania shares was satisfied on 
May 13, 2014, and Volkswagen initiated a squeeze-out for the Scania shares that were not tendered in the course of the offer",,,,,,,,,,
9996," 
At the end of the second extended acceptance period on June 5, 2014, the number of shares tendered under the terms 
of the offer, together with the shares already held by Volkswagen either directly or indirectly, amounted to a total of 796",,,,,,,,,,
9997,"6 
million Scania shares, comprising 398",,,,,,,,,,
9998,7 million A shares and 397,,,,,,,,,,
9999,8 million B shares,,,,,,,,,,

shares and 99",,,,,,,,,,
10002,66% of the voting rights,,,,,,,,,,
10003," 
On completion of the offer, the equity interest in Scania previously attributable to noncontrolling interest share-
holders amounting to €2,123 million was required to be reclassified from noncontrolling interests to the reserves attri-
butable to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG",,,,,,,,,,
10004," The difference of €4,527 million reduced the retained earnings attributable 
to Volkswagen AG shareholders by the same amount",,,,,,,,,,
10005,"  
The changes in the carrying amount of the liability of €96 million that was recognized when the offer was published, 
which were due primarily to exchange rate movements, were recognized in the financial result in profit or loss",,,,,,,,,,
10006," 
In the previous year, the shares already tendered resulted in a cash outflow of €6,535 million, net of exchange rate 
effects",,,,,,,,,,
10007," This amount is reported within financing activities in the cash flow statement for fiscal year 2014 as an outflow 
from capital transactions with noncontrolling interests",,,,,,,,,,
10008," At the prior-year reporting date, a liability of €78 million from put 
options and compensation rights granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders was recognized for the remaining 
shares that are subject to the squeeze-out",,,,,,,,,,
10009," The court of arbitration with jurisdiction has now decided that the remaining 
shares will be transferred to Volkswagen",,,,,,,,,,
10010," On January 14, 2015, it was confirmed to us that the period for appealing against 
this decision had ended",,,,,,,,,,
10011," As of that date, Volkswagen controls 100% of the shares in Scania",,,,,,,,,,
10012," Volkswagen AG paid out the non-
controlling interest shareholders on April 21, 2015",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
214 OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS On August 29, 2015, an arbitration ruling was delivered to the parties in the proceedings between Suzuki Motor Corpo-
ration and Volkswagen AG",,,,,,,,,,
10136, It found that Volkswagen had acted in accordance with the agreement,,,,,,,,,,
10137," The arbitration court 
also confirmed that Suzuki was in breach of contract and, on the merits of this case, acknowledged that Volkswagen had a 
claim to damages",,,,,,,,,,
10138," In addition, the arbitration court established that the parties had the right to give regular notice to 
terminate the cooperation agreement",,,,,,,,,,
10139," It said that Suzuki had exercised this right, ending the partnership",,,,,,,,,,
10140," According to the 
court, the agreements had to be interpreted in such a way that Volkswagen had to sell its equity investment in Suzuki on 
termination of the partnership",,,,,,,,,,
10141, Volkswagen consequently sold its 19,,,,,,,,,,
10142,"9% equity investment to Suzuki on September 17, 
2015 at the quoted market price of €3",,,,,,,,,,
10143,1 billion,,,,,,,,,,
10144, The sale of the shares generated income in the amount of €1,,,,,,,,,,
10145,"5 billion, 
which was recognized in the other financial result",,,,,,,,,,
10146," 
In February 2016, Volkswagen and Suzuki agreed a settlement in respect of the claims for damages brought by Volks-
wagen",,,,,,,,,,
10147," 
Consolidation methods 
The assets and liabilities of the German and foreign companies included in the consolidated financial statements are 
recognized in accordance with the uniform accounting policies used within the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
10148," In the case of com-
panies accounted for using the equity method, the same accounting policies are applied to determine the proportionate 
equity, based on the most recent audited annual financial statements of each company",,,,,,,,,,
10149," 
In the case of subsidiaries consolidated for the first time, assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value at the 
date of acquisition",,,,,,,,,,
10150, Their carrying amounts are adjusted in subsequent years,,,,,,,,,,
10151," Goodwill arises when the purchase price of 
the investment exceeds the fair value of identifiable net assets",,,,,,,,,,
10152," Goodwill is tested for impairment once a year to determine 
whether its carrying amount is recoverable",,,,,,,,,,
10153," If the carrying amount of goodwill is higher than the recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss must be recognized",,,,,,,,,,
10154," If this is not the case, there is no change in the carrying amount of goodwill com-
pared with the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
10155," If the purchase price of the investment is less than the identifiable net assets, the difference is 
recognized in the income statement in the year of acquisition",,,,,,,,,,
10156," Goodwill is accounted for at the subsidiaries in the 
functional currency of those subsidiaries",,,,,,,,,,
10157," Any difference that arises from the acquisition of additional shares of an already 
consolidated subsidiary is taken directly to equity",,,,,,,,,,
10158," Unless otherwise stated, the proportionate equity directly attributable to 
noncontrolling interests is determined at the acquisition date as the share of the fair value of the assets (excluding 
goodwill) and liabilities attributable to them",,,,,,,,,,
10159, Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date,,,,,,,,,,
10160," 
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration do not generally result in the adjustment of the 
acquisition-date measurement",,,,,,,,,,
10161," Acquisition-related costs that are not equity transaction costs are not added to the purchase 
price, but instead recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred",,,,,,,,,,
10162," 
The consolidation process involves adjusting the items in the separate financial statements of the parent and its 
subsidiaries and presenting them as if they were those of a single economic entity",,,,,,,,,,
10163," Intragroup assets, liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows are eliminated in full",,,,,,,,,,
10164," Intercompany profits or losses are eliminated in Group inventories 
and noncurrent assets",,,,,,,,,,
10165," Deferred taxes are recognized for consolidation adjustments, and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are offset where taxes are levied by the same tax authority and relate to the same tax period",,,,,,,,,,

MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES 
With certain exceptions such as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets 
and provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits, items in the Volkswagen Group are accounted for under 
the historical cost convention",,,,,,,,,,
10241, The methods used to measure the individual items are explained in more detail below,,,,,,,,,,
10242," 
 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost and amortized over their useful life using the straight-line method",,,,,,,,,,
10243," This 
relates in particular to software, which is amortized over three years",,,,,,,,,,
10244," 
In accordance with 
IAS 38, research costs are recognized as expenses when incurred",,,,,,,,,,
10245," 
Development costs for future series products and other internally generated intangible assets are capitalized at cost, 
provided manufacture of the products is likely to bring the Volkswagen Group an economic benefit",,,,,,,,,,
10246," If the criteria for 
recognition as assets are not met, the expenses are recognized in the income statement in the year in which they are 
incurred",,,,,,,,,,
10247," 
Capitalized development costs include all direct and indirect costs that are directly attributable to the development 
process",,,,,,,,,,
10248," The costs are amortized using the straight-line method from the start of production over the expected life cycle of 
the models or powertrains developed – generally between two and ten years",,,,,,,,,,
10249," 
Amortization recognized during the year is allocated to the relevant functions in the income statement",,,,,,,,,,
10250," 
Brand names from business combinations usually have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not amortized",,,,,,,,,,
10251," An 
indefinite useful life is usually the result of a brand’s further use and maintenance",,,,,,,,,,
10252," 
Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested 
for impairment at least once a year",,,,,,,,,,
10253," Assets in use and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impair-
ment only if there are specific indications that they may be impaired",,,,,,,,,,
10254," The Volkswagen Group generally applies the higher of 
value in use and fair value less costs to sell of the relevant cash-generating unit (brands or products) to determine the 
recoverable amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets",,,,,,,,,,
10255," Measurement of value in use is based on manage-
ment’s current planning",,,,,,,,,,
10256," This planning is based on expectations regarding future global economic trends and on 
assumptions derived from those trends about the markets for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, market shares and 
the profitability of the products",,,,,,,,,,
10257," The planning for the Financial Services segment is likewise prepared on the basis of these 
expectations, and also reflects the relevant market penetration rates and regulatory requirements",,,,,,,,,,
10258," The planning for the 
Power Engineering segment reflects expectations about trends in the various individual markets",,,,,,,,,,
10259," The planning includes 
reasonable assumptions about macroeconomic trends (exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price trends) and 
historical developments",,,,,,,,,,
10260, The planning period generally covers five years,,,,,,,,,,
10261," For information on the assumptions applied to 
the detailed planning period, please refer to the Report on Expected Developments, which is part of the Management 
Report",,,,,,,,,,
10262," For subsequent years, plausible assumptions are made regarding future trends",,,,,,,,,,
10263," The planning assumptions are 
adapted to reflect the current state of knowledge",,,,,,,,,,
10264,"  
Estimation of cash flows is generally based on the expected growth trends for the markets concerned",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
217  Value in use is determined for the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-
lived intangible assets – mainly capitalized development costs – using the following pretax weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC)  rates, which are adjusted if necessary for country-specific discount factors:

specific need to reflect third-party borrowings",,,,,,,,,,

factors",,,,,,,,,,
10285,"  
The 
WACC rates are calculated based on the risk-free rate of interest, a market risk premium and the cost of debt",,,,,,,,,,
10286," 
Addtionally, specific peer group information on beta factors and leverage are taken into account",,,,,,,,,,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less depreciation and – where necessary – write-downs for impairment",,,,,,,,,,
10288," 
Investment grants are generally deducted from cost",,,,,,,,,,
10289," Cost is determined on the basis of the direct and indirect costs that are 
directly attributable",,,,,,,,,,
10290," Special tools are reported under other equipment, operating and office equipment",,,,,,,,,,
10291," Property, plant 
and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life",,,,,,,,,,
10292," The useful lives of items of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted if required",,,,,,,,,,
10293," 
Depreciation is based mainly on the following useful lives: 


   
   
  

 Useful life


   
Buildings 
 20 to 50 years

Site improvements 
 10 to 20 years

Technical equipment and machinery 
 6 to 12 years

Other equipment, operating and office equipment, including special tools 
 3 to 15 years

 

 
Impairment losses on property, plant and equipment are recognized in accordance with 
IAS 36 where the recoverable 
amount of the asset concerned has fallen below the carrying amount",,,,,,,,,,
10294," Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and 
fair value less costs to sell",,,,,,,,,,
10295, Value in use is determined using the principles described for intangible assets,,,,,,,,,,
10296," The discount 
rates for product-specific tools and investments are the same as the discount rates for capitalized development costs given 
above for each segment",,,,,,,,,,
10297," If the reasons for impairments recognized in previous years no longer apply, the impairment 
losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been 
recognized",,,,,,,,,,
10298," 
In accordance with the principle of substance over form, assets that have been formally transferred to third parties 
under a sale and leaseback transaction including a repurchase option also continue to be accounted for as separate assets",,,,,,,,,,

218 Where leased items of property, plant and equipment are used, the criteria for classification as a finance lease as set out in 
IAS 17 are met if all material risks and rewards incidental to ownership have been transferred to the Group company 
concerned",,,,,,,,,,
10301," In such cases, the assets concerned are recognized at fair value or at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments (if lower) and depreciated using the straight-line method over the asset’s useful life, or over the term of the lease 
if this is shorter",,,,,,,,,,

LEASE ASSETS 
Vehicles leased out under operating leases are recognized at cost and depreciated to their estimated residual value using 
the straight-line method over the term of the lease",,,,,,,,,,
10307," Impairment losses identified as a result of an impairment test in 
accordance with 
IAS 36 are recognized and the depreciation rate is adjusted",,,,,,,,,,
10308," The forecast residual values are adjusted to 
include constantly updated internal and external information on residual values, depending on specific local factors and 
the experiences gained in the marketing of used cars",,,,,,,,,,
10309," This requires management to make assumptions in particular about 
vehicle supply and demand in the future, as well as about vehicle price trends",,,,,,,,,,
10310," Such assumptions are based either on 
qualified estimates or on data published by external experts",,,,,,,,,,
10311," Qualified estimates are based on external data – if available –
that reflects additional information that is available internally, such as historical experience and current sales data",,,,,,,,,,
10312,"  
 
INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
Real estate and buildings held in order to obtain rental income (investment property) are carried at amortized cost; the 
useful lives applied to depreciation generally correspond to those of the property, plant and equipment used by the Com-
pany itself",,,,,,,,,,
10313, The fair value of investment property must be disclosed in the notes if it is carried at amortized cost,,,,,,,,,,
10314," Fair value is 
generally estimated using an investment method based on internal calculations",,,,,,,,,,
10315," This involves determining the income 
value for a specific building on the basis of gross income, taking into account additional factors such as land value, 
remaining useful life and a multiplier specific to property",,,,,,,,,,
10316," 
 
CAPITALIZATION OF BORROWING COSTS 
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of qualifying assets on or after January 1, 2009 are 
capitalized as part of the cost of these assets",,,,,,,,,,
10317," A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes at least a year to get ready 
for its intended use or sale",,,,,,,,,,
10318,"  
 
EQUITY-ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 
The cost of equity-accounted investments is adjusted to reflect the share of increases or reductions in equity at the asso-
ciates and joint ventures after the acquisition that is attributable to the Volkswagen Group, as well as any effects from 
purchase price allocation",,,,,,,,,,
10319," Additionally, the investment is tested for impairment if there are indications of impairment and 
written down to the lower recoverable amount if necessary",,,,,,,,,,

loss is reversed to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized",,,,,,,,,,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one company and a financial liability or an equity 
instrument of another",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
219  IAS 39 classifies financial assets into the following categories: 
> financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; 
> held-to-maturity financial assets; 
> loans and receivables; and 
> and available-for-sale financial assets",,,,,,,,,,
10326," 
 
Financial liabilities are classified into the following categories: 
> financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; and 
> financial liabilities measured at amortized cost",,,,,,,,,,
10327," 
 
We recognize financial instruments at amortized cost or at fair value",,,,,,,,,,
10328," 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount: 
> at which a financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition; 
> minus any principal repayments; 
> minus any write-down for impairment or uncollectibility; 
> plus or minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between the original amount and the amount repayable at 
maturity (premium, discount), amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the financial asset or 
liability",,,,,,,,,,
10329," 
In the case of current receivables and liabilities, amortized cost generally corresponds to the principal or repayment 
amount",,,,,,,,,,
10330," 
Fair value generally corresponds to the market or quoted market price",,,,,,,,,,
10331," If no active market exists, fair value is 
determined using other observable inputs as far as possible",,,,,,,,,,
10332," If no observable inputs are available, fair value is determined 
using valuation techniques, such as by discounting the future cash flows at the market interest rate, or by using recognized 
option pricing models, and, as far as possible, verified by confirmations from the banks that handle the transactions",,,,,,,,,,
10333," 
The fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities is not used in the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,
10334," 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally presented at their gross amounts and only offset if the Volks-
wagen Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to 
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously",,,,,,,,,,
10335," 
Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that are not consolidated for reasons of materiality do not fall within the 
scope of 
IAS 39",,,,,,,,,,
10336," As of fiscal year 2015, the related amounts are therefore excluded from the disclosures in accordance with 
IFRS 7",,,,,,,,,,
10337, Other equity investments that are required by  IAS 39,,,,,,,,,,
10338,"46(c) to be measured at cost, net of any impairment losses to 
be recognized, are presented as “measured at fair value”",,,,,,,,,,
10339," In addition, the tables under 
IFRS 7 were extended to incorpo-
rate a separate class for derivative financial instruments included in hedging relationships",,,,,,,,,,
10340," The relevant tables and prior-
year amounts were adjusted",,,,,,,,,,
10341," 
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Loans, receivables and liabilities, as well as held-to-maturity financial assets, are measured at amortized cost, unless 
hedged",,,,,,,,,,
10342," Specifically, these relate to: 
> receivables from financing business; 
> trade receivables and payables; 
> other receivables and financial assets and liabilities; 
> financial liabilities; and 
> cash, cash equivalents and time deposits",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
220 AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets are either allocated specifically to this category or are financial assets that cannot be 
assigned to any other category",,,,,,,,,,
10345," 
Available-for-sale financial assets (debt instruments) are carried at fair value",,,,,,,,,,
10346," Changes in fair value are recognized 
directly in equity, net of deferred taxes",,,,,,,,,,
10347," Prolonged changes in the fair value of debt instruments (impairment losses, 
foreign exchange gains and losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method) are recognized in profit or loss",,,,,,,,,,
10348,"  
Other equity investments (shares representing an ownership interest of less than 20% as a rule) are also classified as 
available-for-sale financial assets",,,,,,,,,,
10349," They are recognized at cost in the consolidated financial statements if there is no active 
market for those shares and fair values cannot be reliably ascertained without undue cost or effort",,,,,,,,,,
10350," The lower present value 
of the estimated future cash flows is recognized if there are indications of impairment",,,,,,,,,,
10351," There is currently no intention to 
sell these financial assets",,,,,,,,,,
10352," Foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to equity instruments are recognized in other 
comprehensive income",,,,,,,,,,
10353," 
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
Volkswagen Group companies use derivatives to hedge balance sheet items and future cash flows (hedged items)",,,,,,,,,,
10354," Appro-
priate derivatives such as swaps, forward transactions and options are used as hedging instruments",,,,,,,,,,
10355," The criteria for the 
application of hedge accounting are that the hedging relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is 
clearly documented and that the hedge is highly effective",,,,,,,,,,
10356," 
The accounting treatment of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship",,,,,,,,,,
10357," In the case of hedges against the risk of change in the carrying amount of balance sheet items (fair value 
hedges), both the hedging instrument and the hedged risk portion of the hedged item are measured at fair value",,,,,,,,,,
10358," Several 
risk portions of hedged items are grouped into a portfolio if appropriate",,,,,,,,,,
10359," In the case of a fair value portfolio hedge, the 
changes in fair value are accounted for in the same way as for a fair value hedge of an individual underlying",,,,,,,,,,
10360," Gains or losses 
from the remeasurement of hedging instruments and hedged items are recognized in profit or loss",,,,,,,,,,
10361," In the case of hedges 
of future cash flows (cash flow hedges), the hedging instruments are also measured at fair value",,,,,,,,,,
10362," Gains or losses from 
remeasurement of the effective portion of the derivative are initially recognized in the reserve for cash flow hedges directly 
in equity, and are only recognized in the income statement when the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss; the 
ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in profit or loss",,,,,,,,,,
10363,"  
Derivatives used by the Volkswagen Group for financial management purposes to hedge against interest rate, foreign 
currency, commodity, or price risks, but that do not meet the strict hedge accounting criteria of 
IAS 39, are classified as 
financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (also referred to below as “derivatives not included in 
hedging relationships”)",,,,,,,,,,
10364, This also applies to options on shares,,,,,,,,,,
10365," External hedges of intragroup hedged items that are sub-
sequently eliminated in the consolidated financial statements are also assigned to this category as a general rule",,,,,,,,,,
10366," Assets 
and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss consist of derivatives or components of derivatives that are not 
included in hedge accounting",,,,,,,,,,
10367," These relate primarily to the interest component of currency forwards used to hedge sales 
revenue, commodity futures and currency forwards relating to commodity futures",,,,,,,,,,
10368," Gains and losses from the remeasure-
ment and settlement of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are reported in the financial result",,,,,,,,,,
10369," 
RECEIVABLES FROM FINANCE LEASES 
Where a Group company is the lessor – generally of vehicles – a receivable in the amount of the net investment in the lease 
is recognized in the case of finance leases, in other words where substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred to 
the lessee",,,,,,,,,,
10370," 
 
OTHER RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Other receivables and financial assets (except for derivatives) are recognized at amortized cost",,,,,,,,,,

10372,"   
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
221  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Default risk on loans and receivables in the financial services business is accounted for by recognizing specific valuation 
allowances and portfolio-based valuation allowances",,,,,,,,,,
10373,"  
More specifically, in the case of significant individual receivables (e",,,,,,,,,,
10374,g,,,,,,,,,,
10375," dealer finance receivables and fleet customer 
business receivables) specific valuation allowances are recognized in accordance with Group-wide standards in the amount 
of the incurred loss",,,,,,,,,,
10376," A potential impairment is assumed in the case of a number of situations such as delayed payment over 
a certain period, the institution of enforcement measures, the threat of insolvency or overindebtedness, application for or 
the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, or the failure of reorganization measures",,,,,,,,,,
10377,"  
Portfolio-based valuation allowances are recognized by grouping together insignificant receivables and significant 
individual receivables for which there is no indication of impairment into homogeneous portfolios on the basis of com-
parable credit risk features and allocating them by risk class",,,,,,,,,,
10378," As long as no definite information is available as to which 
receivables are in default, average historical default probabilities for the portfolio concerned are used to calculate the 
amount of the valuation allowances",,,,,,,,,,
10379,"  
As a matter of principle, specific valuation allowances are recognized on receivables outside the Financial Services 
segment",,,,,,,,,,
10380,"  
Valuation allowances on receivables are regularly recognized in separate allowance accounts",,,,,,,,,,
10381," 
An impairment loss is recognized on available-for-sale financial assets if there is objective evidence of permanent 
impairment",,,,,,,,,,
10382," In the case of equity instruments, evidence of impairment is taken to exist, among other things, if the fair value 
decreases below cost significantly (by more than 20%) or the decrease is prolonged (by more than 10% of the average 
market prices over one year)",,,,,,,,,,
10383," If impairment is identified, the cumulative loss is recognized in the reserve and charged to 
profit and loss",,,,,,,,,,
10384," In the case of equity instruments, reversals of impairment losses are taken directly to equity",,,,,,,,,,
10385," Impairment 
losses are recognized on debt instruments if a decrease in the future cash flows of the financial asset is expected",,,,,,,,,,
10386," An 
increase in the risk-free interest rate or an increase in credit risk premiums is not in itself evidence of impairment",,,,,,,,,,
10387," 
DEFERRED TAXES 
Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for tax-deductible temporary differences between the tax base of assets and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet, as well as on tax loss carryforwards and tax credits provided it is 
probable that they can be used in future periods",,,,,,,,,,
10388," Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary 
differences between the tax base of liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet",,,,,,,,,,
10389," 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized in the amount of the expected tax liability or tax benefit, as appro-
priate, in subsequent fiscal years, based on the expected enacted tax rate at the time of realization",,,,,,,,,,
10390," The tax consequences of 
dividend payments are generally not taken into account until the resolution on appropriation of earnings available for 
distribution has been adopted",,,,,,,,,,
10391," 
Deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be realized within a clearly predictable period are reduced by valuation 
allowances",,,,,,,,,,
10392," 
Deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards are usually measured on the basis of future taxable income over a planning 
period of five fiscal years",,,,,,,,,,
10393," 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and 
relate to the same tax period",,,,,,,,,,
10394," 
INVENTORIES 
Raw materials, consumables and supplies, merchandise, work in progress and self-produced finished goods reported in 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
224 ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BY MANAGEMENT  Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses, as well as the related disclosure of con-
tingent assets and liabilities of the reporting period",,,,,,,,,,
10466," The estimates and assumptions relate largely to the following matters:  
The impairment testing of nonfinancial assets (especially goodwill, brand names, capitalized development costs and 
special tools) and equity-accounted investments, or investments accounted at cost, and the measurement of options on 
shares in companies that are not traded in an active market require assumptions about the future cash flows during the 
planning period, and possibly beyond it, as well as about the discount rate to be applied",,,,,,,,,,
10467," The estimates made in order to 
separate cash flows mainly relate to future market shares, the trend in the respective markets and the profitability of the 
Volkswagen Group’s products",,,,,,,,,,
10468," In addition, the recoverability of the Group’s lease assets depends in particular on the 
residual value of the leased vehicles after expiration of the lease term, because this represents a significant portion of the 
expected cash flows",,,,,,,,,,
10469," More detailed information on impairment tests and the measurement parameters used for those tests 
can be found in the explanations on the accounting policies for intangible assets",,,,,,,,,,
10470,"  
If there are no observable market inputs, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business com-
bination are measured using recognized valuation techniques, such as the relief-from-royalty method or the residual 
method",,,,,,,,,,
10471," 
Impairment testing of financial assets requires estimates about the extent and probability of occurrence of future events",,,,,,,,,,
10472," 
As far as possible, estimates are derived from past experience taking into account current market data as well as rating 
categories and scoring information",,,,,,,,,,
10473," In the case of financial services receivables, both specific and portfolio-based 
valuation allowances are recognized",,,,,,,,,,
10474," The more detailed balance sheet disclosures on 
IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments) 
contain an overview of these specific and portfolio-based valuation allowances",,,,,,,,,,
10475,"  
Accounting for provisions is also based on estimates of the extent and probability of occurrence of future events, as well 
as estimates of the discount rate",,,,,,,,,,
10476," As far as possible, these are also based on past experience or external opinions",,,,,,,,,,
10477," In 
addition, the measurement of pension provisions depends on the estimated growth in plan assets",,,,,,,,,,
10478," The assumptions under-
lying the measurement of pension provisions are contained in note 29",,,,,,,,,,
10479," Remeasurements are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and do not affect profit or loss reported in the income statement",,,,,,,,,,
10480," Any change in the estimates of the 
amount of other provisions is always recognized in profit or loss",,,,,,,,,,
10481," The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new 
information obtained",,,,,,,,,,
10482," The use of empirical values means that additional amounts must frequently be recognized for 
provisions, or that unused provisions are reversed",,,,,,,,,,
10483," Reversals of provisions are recognized as other operating income, 
whereas expenses relating to the recognition of provisions are allocated directly to the functions",,,,,,,,,,
10484," Warranty claims from 
sales transactions are calculated on the basis of losses to date, estimated future losses and the policy on ex gratia arrange-
ments",,,,,,,,,,
10485, This requires assumptions to be made about the nature and extent of future guarantee and ex gratia claims,,,,,,,,,,
10486,"  
 
  ",,,,,,,,,,
10487,"   
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
225  Assumptions were made in respect of the warranty provisions recognized in connection with the diesel issues",,,,,,,,,,
10488," These 
depend on the series, model year and country concerned and relate in particular to the effort, material costs and hourly 
wage rates involved, or to vehicle values in the case of repurchases",,,,,,,,,,
10489," They are based on qualified estimates, which are based 
in turn on external data, and also reflect additional information available internally, such as values derived from past 
experience",,,,,,,,,,
10490, Note 30 contains an overview of other provisions,,,,,,,,,,
10491," For information on litigation and legal risks associated with 
the diesel issue, see also note 37",,,,,,,,,,
10492," The put options and compensation rights of free float shareholders recognized within 
liabilities depend in particular on the outcome of the 
MAN award proceedings",,,,,,,,,,
10493," The liability was based on estimates of the 
length of the award proceedings and the amount of the put options and compensation rights",,,,,,,,,,
10494," The length was estimated 
based on the fact that proceedings take seven years on average",,,,,,,,,,
10495," The amount of the put options and compensation rights of 
MAN’s free float shareholders is derived from the cash settlement in accordance with section 305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG 
– German Stock Corporation Act)",,,,,,,,,,
10496," The cash settlement payable was adjusted in the fiscal year due to the ruling by the Munich 
Regional Court",,,,,,,,,,
10497," 
Government grants are recognized based on an assessment as to whether there is reasonable assurance that the 
Group companies will fulfill the attached conditions and the grants will be awarded",,,,,,,,,,
10498," This assessment is based on the nature 
of the legal entitlement and past experience",,,,,,,,,,
10499,"  
Estimates of the useful life of finite-lived assets are based on past experience and are reviewed regularly",,,,,,,,,,
10500," Where 
estimates are modified the residual useful life is adjusted and an impairment loss is recognized, if necessary",,,,,,,,,,
10501,"  
Measuring deferred tax assets requires assumptions regarding future taxable income and the timing of the realization 
of deferred tax assets",,,,,,,,,,
10502,"  
The estimates and assumptions are based on underlying assumptions that reflect the current state of available knowl-
edge",,,,,,,,,,
10503," Specifically, the expected future development of business was based on the circumstances known at the date of 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements and a realistic assessment of the future development of the global 
and sector-specific environment",,,,,,,,,,
10504," Our estimates and assumptions remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty because 
future business developments are subject to uncertainties that in part cannot be influenced by the Group",,,,,,,,,,
10505," This applies in 
particular to short- and medium-term cash flow forecasts and to the discount rates used",,,,,,,,,,
10506,"  
Developments in this environment that differ from the assumptions and that cannot be influenced by management 
could result in amounts that differ from the original estimates",,,,,,,,,,
10507," If actual developments differ from the expected develop-
ments, the underlying assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities affected are 
adjusted",,,,,,,,,,
10508," 
The moderate global economic growth slowed to 2",,,,,,,,,,
10509,5% in fiscal year 2015,,,,,,,,,,
10510," Our planning assumes that the global eco-
nomy will grow at a rather stronger pace in 2016 than it did in the previous year",,,,,,,,,,
10511," As a result, from today’s perspective, we 
are not expecting material adjustments in the following fiscal year in the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities 
reported in the consolidated balance sheet",,,,,,,,,,
10512," 
Estimates and assumptions by management were based in particular on assumptions relating to the development of 
the general economic environment, the automotive markets and the legal environment",,,,,,,,,,
10513," These and further assumptions 
are explained in detail in the Report on Expected Developments, which is part of the Group Management Report",,,,,,,,,,
10514,"

particular the nature of the products or services, integration in the development, production and sales processes, and 
similar customer groups)",,,,,,,,,,
10520," 
The activities of the Passenger Cars segment cover the development of vehicles and engines, the production and sale of 
passenger cars, and the corresponding genuine parts business",,,,,,,,,,
10521," As a rule, the Volkswagen Group’s individual passenger car 
brands are combined on a consolidated basis into a single reportable segment",,,,,,,,,,

losses of equity-accounted investments in the corresponding segments",,,,,,,,,,
10528,"  
The reconciliation contains activities and other operations that by definition do not constitute segments",,,,,,,,,,
10529," It also 
includes the unallocated Group financing activities",,,,,,,,,,

in the reconciliation",,,,,,,,,,
10531," 
Investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property are reported net of invest-
ments under finance leases",,,,,,,,,,

SIGNIFICANT PENSION ARRANGEMENTS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
For the period after their active working life, the Volkswagen Group offers its employees benefits under attractive, modern 
occupational pension arrangements",,,,,,,,,,
10955," Most of the arrangements in the Volkswagen Group are pension plans for employees 
in Germany classified as defined benefit plans under 
IAS 19",,,,,,,,,,
10956," The majority of these obligations are funded solely by 
recognized provisions",,,,,,,,,,
10957, These plans are now largely closed to new members,,,,,,,,,,
10958," To reduce the risks associated with defined 
benefit plans, in particular longevity, salary increases and inflation, the Volkswagen Group has introduced new defined 
benefit plans in recent years whose benefits are funded by appropriate external plan assets",,,,,,,,,,
10959," The above-mentioned risks 
have been largely reduced in these pension plans",,,,,,,,,,
10960," The proportion of the total defined benefit obligation attributable to 
pension obligations funded by plan assets will continue to rise in the future",,,,,,,,,,
10961," The significant pension plans are described in 
the following",,,,,,,,,,
10962," 
 
German pension plans funded solely by recognized provisions 
The pension plans funded solely by recognized provisions comprise both contribution-based plans with guarantees and 
final salary plans",,,,,,,,,,
10963," For contribution-based plans, an annual pension expense dependent on income and status is converted 
into a lifelong pension entitlement using annuity factors (guaranteed modular pension entitlements)",,,,,,,,,,
10964," The annuity factors 
include a guaranteed rate of interest",,,,,,,,,,
10965," At retirement, the modular pension entitlements earned annually are added together",,,,,,,,,,
10966," 
For final salary plans, the underlying salary is multiplied at retirement by a percentage that depends on the years of service 
up until the retirement date",,,,,,,,,,
10967," 
The present value of the guaranteed obligation rises as interest rates fall and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk",,,,,,,,,,
10968," 
The pension system provides for lifelong pension payments",,,,,,,,,,
10969, The companies bear the longevity risk in this respect,,,,,,,,,,
10970," This 
is accounted for by calculating the annuity factors and the present value of the guaranteed obligation using the latest 
generational mortality tables – the “Heubeck 2005 G” mortality tables – which already reflect future increases in life expec-
tancy",,,,,,,,,,
10971," 
To reduce the inflation risk from adjusting the regular pension payments by the rate of inflation, a pension adjustment 
that is not indexed to inflation was introduced for pension plans where this is permitted by law",,,,,,,,,,

 ",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
259  German pension plans funded by external plan assets 
The pension plans funded by external plan assets are contribution-based plans with guarantees",,,,,,,,,,
10974," In this case, an annual 
pension expense dependent on income and status is either converted into a lifelong pension entitlement using annuity 
factors (guaranteed modular pension entitlement) or paid out in a single lump sum or in installments",,,,,,,,,,
10975," In some cases, 
employees also have the opportunity to provide for their own retirement through deferred compensation",,,,,,,,,,
10976," The annuity 
factors include a guaranteed rate of interest",,,,,,,,,,
10977," At retirement, the modular pension entitlements earned annually are added 
together",,,,,,,,,,
10978," The pension expense is contributed on an ongoing basis to a separate pool of assets that is administered indepen-
dently of the Company in trust and invested in the capital markets",,,,,,,,,,
10979," If the plan assets exceed the present value of the 
obligations calculated using the guaranteed rate of interest, surpluses are allocated (modular pension bonuses)",,,,,,,,,,
10980," 
Since the assets administered in trust meet the 
IAS 19 criteria for classification as plan assets, they are deducted from 
the obligations",,,,,,,,,,
10981," 
The amount of the pension assets is exposed to general market risk",,,,,,,,,,
10982," The investment strategy and its implementation 
are therefore continuously monitored by the trusts’ governing bodies, on which the companies are also represented",,,,,,,,,,
10983," For 
example, investment policies are stipulated in investment guidelines with the aim of limiting market risk and its impact on 
plan assets",,,,,,,,,,
10984," In addition, asset-liability management studies are conducted if required so as to ensure that investments are 
in line with the obligations that need to be covered",,,,,,,,,,
10985," The pension assets are currently invested primarily in fixed-income or 
equity funds",,,,,,,,,,
10986, The main risks are therefore interest rate and equity price risk,,,,,,,,,,
10987," To mitigate market risk, the pension system 
also provides for cash funds to be set aside in an equalization reserve before any surplus is allocated",,,,,,,,,,
10988," 
The present value of the obligation is the present value of the guaranteed obligation after deducting the plan assets",,,,,,,,,,
10989," If 
the plan assets fall below the present value of the guaranteed obligation, a provision must be recognized in that amount",,,,,,,,,,
10990," 
The present value of the guaranteed obligation rises as interest rates fall and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk",,,,,,,,,,
10991," 
In the case of lifelong pension payments, the Volkswagen Group bears the longevity risk",,,,,,,,,,
10992," This is accounted for by 
calculating the annuity factors and the present value of the guaranteed obligation using the latest generational mortality 
tables – the “Heubeck 2005 G” mortality tables – which already reflect future increases in life expectancy",,,,,,,,,,
10993," In addition, the 
independent actuaries carry out annual risk monitoring as part of the review of the assets administered by the trusts",,,,,,,,,,
10994," 
To reduce the inflation risk from adjusting the regular pension payments by the rate of inflation, a pension adjustment 
that is not indexed to inflation was introduced for pension plans where this is permitted by law",,,,,,,,,,

special purpose entity by way of undisclosed assignment, the situation may occur in which the receivable has already been

owed to it by a company belonging to the Volkswagen Group",,,,,,,,,,

prises at a maximum the amount of the claims under carrying amounts receivable from them and the irrevocable credit 
commitments",,,,,,,,,,
11230," The maximum potential credit and default risk is reduced by collateral held and other credit enhancements 
in the amount of €74,115 million (previous year: €66,555 million)",,,,,,,,,,
11231," The collateral held relates solely to financial assets 
carried at amortized cost and mainly serves to secure financial services receivables and trade receivables",,,,,,,,,,

prises vehicles and assets transferred as security, as well as guarantees and real property liens",,,,,,,,,,
11233," Cash collateral is also used 
in hedging transactions",,,,,,,,,,
11234," The risk arising from nonderivative financial instruments is also accounted for by recognizing 
bad debt losses",,,,,,,,,,
11235," Significant cash and capital investments, as well as derivatives, are only entered into with national and 
international banks of good credit standing",,,,,,,,,,
11236," Risk is additionally limited by a limit system based primarily on the equity base 
of the counterparties concerned and on credit assessments by international rating agencies",,,,,,,,,,
11237," Financial guarantees issued 
also give rise to credit and default risk",,,,,,,,,,
11238," The maximum potential credit and default risk is calculated from the amount Volks-
wagen would have to pay if claims were to be asserted under the guarantees",,,,,,,,,,
11239," The corresponding amounts are presented in 
the Liquidity risk section",,,,,,,,,,

There were no material concentrations of risk at individual counterparties or counterparty groups in the past fiscal 
year due to the global allocation of the Group’s business activities and the resulting diversification",,,,,,,,,,

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
282 The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges represents the income and expenses from changes in the fair value of hedging 
instruments that exceed the changes in the fair value of the hedged items but that are documented to be within the per-
mitted range of 80% to 125% overall when measuring effectiveness",,,,,,,,,,
11293," Such income or expenses are recognized directly in 
the financial result",,,,,,,,,,
11294," 
In 2015, €3,864 million (previous year: €298 million), in both cases reducing earnings, from the cash flow hedge 
reserve was transferred to the other operating result, while €3 million (previous year: €2 million, increasing earnings) was 
transferred to the financial result, reducing earnings, and €90 million (previous year: €27 million), in both cases reducing 
earnings, was included in the cost of sales",,,,,,,,,,
11295," 
The Volkswagen Group uses two different methods to present market risk from nonderivative and derivative financial 
instruments in accordance with 
IFRS 7",,,,,,,,,,
11296," For quantitative risk measurement, interest rate and foreign currency risk in the 
Volkswagen Financial Services subgroup are measured using a value-at-risk (VaR) model on the basis of a historical simu-
lation, while market risk in the other Group companies is determined using a sensitivity analysis",,,,,,,,,,
11297," The value-at-risk calcu-
lation indicates the size of the maximum potential loss on the portfolio as a whole within a time horizon of 40 days, 
measured at a confidence level of 99%",,,,,,,,,,
11298," To provide the basis for this calculation, all cash flows from nonderivative and 
derivative financial instruments are aggregated into an interest rate gap analysis",,,,,,,,,,
11299," The historical market data used in 
calculating value at risk covers a period of 1,000 trading days",,,,,,,,,,

swaps are used to limit foreign currency risk",,,,,,,,,,

invested capital of 9%, which applies to both the business units and the individual products and product lines",,,,,,,,,,

not estimate the litigants’ prospect of success to be more than 50% in any of the aforementioned proceedings aimed at 
asserting damages",,,,,,,,,,

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 
HGB and German generally accepted 
standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) 
(
IDW)",,,,,,,,,,
11791," Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net 
assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework and in the combined management report are detected with reasonable assurance",,,,,,,,,,
11792," Knowledge of the business 
activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the 
determination of audit procedures",,,,,,,,,,
11793," The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report are examined primarily on a test basis within 
the framework of the audit",,,,,,,,,,
11794," The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the 
determination of the entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates 
made by the Company´s Board of Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and 
the combined management report",,,,,,,,,,
11795, We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion,,,,,,,,,,

  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Auditor’s Report 
303  In our opinion based on the findings of our audit the consolidated financial statements comply with the  IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the 
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a Abs",,,,,,,,,,
11799," 1 
HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial 
position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these provisions",,,,,,,,,,
11800," The combined management report is consistent with 
the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities 
and risks of future development",,,,,,,,,,
11801," 
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the information provided and statements made in section “Key events” of the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and in section “The Emissions Issue” of the combined management report with regard to the 
emission issue, the underlying causes, the involvement of members of the board of management as well as the impact on these financial 
statements",,,,,,,,,,
11802,"  
Based on the presented first results of the various measures taken to investigate the issue, which underlie these financial statements, 
there is no validation that members of the board of management were aware of the deliberate manipulation of engine management 
software before summer 2015",,,,,,,,,,
11803," Nevertheless, should as a result of the ongoing investigation new knowledge be obtained showing that 
members of the board of management were informed earlier, this could eventually have an impact on the annual and consolidated 
financial statements and on the combined management report for the fiscal year 2015 and the comparative figures for 2014",,,,,,,,,,
11804,"  
The provisions for warranties and legal risks recorded in the financial year 2015 totalling €14",,,,,,,,,,
11805,"8 billion are based on the presented state 
of knowledge",,,,,,,,,,
11806," Due to the large number of the technical solutions necessary and the inevitable uncertainties associated with the current and 
expected litigation it cannot be excluded that a future assessment of the risks may be different",,,,,,,,,,

Matthias Müller (62) has been  CEO of Volkswagen AG  since 
the end of September 2015",,,,,,,,,,

notion of leadership, and about the future of the Group",,,,,,,,,,
11885,"
 
 
QUESTIONS:  Johannes Winterhagen 
 PHOTOGRAPHY: Hartmut Nägele
Mr",,,,,,,,,,
11886," Müller, what does trust mean for you personally? 
Everything is based on trust, as much in our private lives as 
in the world of business",,,,,,,,,,
11887," In connection with the Diesel issue 
at Volkswagen 
rules were broken and ethical boundaries 
overstepped",,,,,,,,,,
11888," As a 
result, we disappointed many people and 
forfeited trust – 
among customers, investors and employees 
as well as with the 
political community and the public",,,,,,,,,,
11889," So our 
goal now is to win back that trust",,,,,,,,,,
11890," And I also see that as my 
most important task",,,,,,,,,,
11891,"
How can you succeed in regaining trust? You can build trust 
by acknowledging your mistake and demonstrating your  
firm resolve to fix things – not just the consequences, but also 
the underlying causes",,,,,,,,,,
11892," In our case that includes convincing 
technical solutions for our customers just as much as the re-
lentless clarification of what happened",,,,,,,,,,
11893," Looking towards  
the future, it is vital that we learn from mistakes and draw the 
right conclusions, so that nothing like this can ever happen 
again at Volkswagen",,,,,,,,,,
11894," 
What specific steps are called for to make sure an error of 
such magnitude does not happen again?
 We must analyze 
all relevant workflows, identify the weak points and eradicate 
them",,,,,,,,,,
11895," 
We are going to great lengths to do precisely that",,,,,,,,,,
11896,"  
And we are also working on our error management culture",,,,,,,,,,
11897," 
Mistakes are a fact of life",,,,,,,,,,
11898," It must be possible to talk openly 
about problems, at all hierarchy levels",,,,,,,,,,
11899," What is crucial, though, 
is that we are willing to learn from that",,,,,,,,,,
11900,— 76,,,,,,,,,,
11901,"You have emphasized on several occasions that Volkswagen 
will not allow itself to be paralyzed by the crisis",,,,,,,,,,
11902," What  
do you mean by that?
 We need to safeguard Volkswagen’s  
future viability in a world facing fundamental change",,,,,,,,,,
11903," We 
were extremely successful for many years",,,,,,,,,,
11904," For that success to 
continue under changed circumstances we need to realign 
the Group: our structures, our mindset and our actions – in 
other words, what is commonly known as our “corporate  
culture” – as well as in terms of our strategic goals for the 
 
fu
ture",,,,,,,,,,
11905, We are making progress in all of these areas,,,,,,,,,,
11906," In that 
sense, you could say the crisis has opened doors",,,,,,,,,,
11907,"
You just raised the subject of culture",,,,,,,,,,
11908," What is your notion 
of good leadership?
 First and foremost open communication, 
readiness to accept responsibility, and a bold entrepreneurial 
spirit",,,,,,,,,,
11909," We may have been remiss in fostering this 
attitude in 
the past",,,,,,,,,,
11910," Of course, in a company of our size, a fundamental 
change in leadership style will not happen overnight",,,,,,,,,,
11911," You 
cannot stand at the factory gate with a megaphone in your hand 
and proclaim a new culture",,,,,,,,,,
11912," The crucial point is that we as 
the Board of Management live up to the new form of coopera-
tion, day in, day out",,,,,,,,,,
11913,"  
What does that mean for you personally? Before I make a 
decision, I talk to the employees who are best able to give me 
the facts and information I need – regardless of where they 
stand in the hierarchy",,,,,,,,,,
11914," And I listen very carefully, especially 
when opinions differ from my own",,,,,,,,,,
11915," 
The brands are to be given greater independence in future",,,,,,,,,,
11916," 
How will you nevertheless be able to leverage technical 
synergies in the Group? During my time at Porsche we enjoyed 
a large measure of freedom and achieved very good results",,,,,,,,,,
11917," 
This independence and autonomy will do all the brands good",,,,,,,,,,
11918," 
We will leverage synergies by bundling key functions in the 
Group Board of Management",,,,,,,,,,
11919," That applies, for instance, to 
brand and product strategy or to the major technologies of  the future",,,,,,,,,,
11920," We set the framework, and the individual brand 
groups have the greatest possible autonomy for action within 
that framework",,,,,,,,,,
11921," That is how we can make the Group more  
ef
ficient, faster and more flexible as well as harnessing its  
immense potential even more effectively in future",,,,,,,,,,
11922,"
You are also strengthening the regions",,,,,,,,,,
11923," So where will 
Wolfsburg actually have a say in future? At headquarters, 
we define the regions where we see particularly good growth 
opportunities and determine which brands will develop these 
openings",,,,,,,,,,
11924," But the actual implementation should be decen-
tral
ized, because local markets know customers’ requirements 
best",,,,,,,,,,
11925," That, too, is a question of trust",,,,,,,,,,
11926,"
What are you doing to get Volkswagen back on the road  
to success?
 Obviously, our top priority is solving the emissions 
issue in the best interests of our customers",,,,,,,,,,
11927," At the same time, 
we must develop ideas as to where the Group and the individual 
brands are headed in the long term",,,,,,,,,,
11928," That is why we are work-
ing hard on a “Strategy 2025”",,,,,,,,,,
11929," 
What is special about this new strategy? Overall, “Strategy 
2018” was very successful, which is why we do not have to 
throw everything overboard",,,,,,,,,,
11930," The new strategy is about taking 
the next bold step, putting greater emphasis on elements 
such as digitalization, electro-mobility and a proactive ap-
proach to sustainability",,,,,,,,,,
11931," These are the issues that deter-
mine the future, so they have to be right at the top of our agenda",,,,,,,,,,
11932," 
I feel it is important that the new strategy is not devised by a 
few people sitting in an ivory tower, but is created in an open 
and structured process",,,,,,,,,,
11933,"  
Can a traditional car maker set trends in digitalization? 
That must be our mission",,,,,,,,,,
11934," Our customers expect us to connect 
their vehicles with their digital world",,,,,,,,,,
11935," And we do not want  
to leave that to players from outside our industry",,,,,,,,,,
11936," Quite the 
reverse: one of our fundamental tasks is to develop new

services and business models that relate to every aspect of our 
core product – the car",,,,,,,,,,
11939," In order to do that, we will be building 
up or expanding the necessary know-how in-house as well as 
opening up more to cooperation initiatives",,,,,,,,,,
11940," 
Electro-mobility is one strategic focus: when will the  
electric car be ready for the mass market? 
The Volkswagen 
Group has invested many millions in developing electric  
vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
11941," The upshot of that investment is a range of very  
attractive electric cars and plug-in hybrids",,,,,,,,,,
11942," We will be 
launch
ing more than 20 further models by 2020",,,,,,,,,,
11943," By the end 
of this decade, a new battery technology that will allow us  
to offer vehicles with a range of 500 kilometers will be avail-
able",,,,,,,,,,
11944, But that alone will not be sufficient,,,,,,,,,,
11945," At the same time,  
for instance, an extensive charging infrastructure, especially 
on highways, must also be put in place",,,,,,,,,,
11946," Our industry advo-
cates that",,,,,,,,,,
11947,"  Looking to the future, what role will size play for Volkswagen? 
Size in terms of how many vehicles you sell is not an end in  
itself",,,,,,,,,,
11948, We prefer to concentrate on value-added growth,,,,,,,,,,
11949," We 
want to generate a financial performance that provides us 
with adequate means to make bold, sustainable investments 
in the future",,,,,,,,,,

Future Days”",,,,,,,,,,
12035," Experts from all over the Group meet up at 
these workshops to discuss one specific issue, such as how to 
introduce customer identification throughout the Group",,,,,,,,,,
12036," At 
first glance, that might seem like a technical detail, but in the 
age of digitization it is in fact extremely important: “We need 
unambiguous customer identification – even if the customer 
purchased the vehicle from an independent dealer or bought  
it 
second hand – because that is the only way we can offer them 
digital services tailored to their requirements, such as apps  
or services specifically designed for their particular model”, 
Geffers explains",,,,,,,,,,
12037,"
This focused search for ideas is one aspect of the work per-
formed by the “Ideation:Hub”",,,,,,,,,,
12038," The second, equally important 
aspect is the meticulous evaluation of ideas",,,,,,,,,,
12039," On behalf of 
Group IT, Geffers provides follow-up support for “hackathons”; 
these are events where young programmers come together  
to develop new digital solutions and apps",,,,,,,,,,
12040," At one particular 
competition, the “Carvatar” app caught her eye: this game 
software encourages drivers to take care of their car, for in-
stance by making sure they do not miss a service check",,,,,,,,,,
12041," If, 
like this one, an idea seems innovative and practicable, Geffers 
networks the IT talent with specialists from the Group",,,,,,,,,,
12042," In 
fact, Geffers’ mission could be described as making sure that 
no good idea is overlooked",,,,,,,,,,

small group of developers who set out in 2010 to make Audi a 
pioneer of highly automated driving; he himself became the 
project manager",,,,,,,,,,
12049," What is his motivation? Is he trying to make 
the driver superfluous? Müller vehemently rejects that idea: 
“On the contrary, this is about self-determination! Piloted driving 
should give people greater freedom to organize their time",,,,,,,,,,
12050,"” The 
first piloted driving model, where the driver can activate a 
traffic jam pilot for stop-and-go traffic, is scheduled to go into 
production soon",,,,,,,,,,

Great technological progress has been made in automated 
driving",,,,,,,,,,
12053," The central controller, which took up the entire boot 
in the first test vehicles, is now no larger than a laptop",,,,,,,,,,
12054," Never-
theless, Müller puts a damper on any expectations of highly  
automated driving in every situation – that is not just a ques-
tion of the technology, the infrastructure and legal regulations, 
it is also because of people: “Drivers have to build faith in a 
self-driving car, so it is quite right to take things step by step",,,,,,,,,,

12058," The 
interface between the driver and the piloted car must become 
much more sophisticated than is the case in today’s vehicles",,,,,,,,,,
12059," 
For example, drivers must always be given a clear signal whether 
the car is in automated mode or whether to intervene manually",,,,,,,,,,
12060," 
They must be able to take back control of the vehicle within ten 
seconds, even if they have just been checking emails",,,,,,,,,,
12061," And pilot-
ed driving should feel good as well",,,,,,,,,,
12062," “This isn’t so much about 
getting to your destination quickly, but more about enjoying 
the time you spend traveling in comfortable and attractive sur-
roundings”, Müller says",,,,,,,,,,
12063," “People can decide for themselves 
whether they want to use their time to work or just sit back and 
enjoy – a bit like a business class flight with a good airline",,,,,,,,,,

But with one crucial difference: you can decide at any 
stage dur-

Audi believes piloted driving offers four  
main benefits to people and society:
IMPROVED FUEL ECONOMY
Highly automated cars are expected to improve fuel 
economy by 
three to five percent compared with  
conventional cars because sensor data and networking  
with road traffic mean that such cars drive more  
smoothly and accelerate and brake less frequently",,,,,,,,,,

nity to test and shape their future workplace",,,,,,,,,,

Digital networking between the truck and the freight company 
will change the driver’s job quite significantly",,,,,,,,,,
12083," More and

able; for example, information on spontaneous changes in 
the route, which results in fewer empty runs and in turn reduces 
the environmental impact",,,,,,,,,,
12084," In theory, the possibilities for  
presenting information to the driver are endless, particularly 
given the constant stream of new display technologies",,,,,,,,,,

one 
clear priority: “We want to find out how to design dis-
plays so

12086,"”    Work on new HMI concepts is particularly relevant for auto-
mated truck driving",,,,,,,,,,
12087," Scania is one of the participants in a 
project that is researching into “platooning”: this is a system 
whereby trucks drive themselves in tight formation on the 
highway, automatically following a lead truck",,,,,,,,,,
12088," The smaller  
inter-vehicle distance reduces aerodynamic drag, similar  
to slipstreaming in cycle racing and therefore also cuts fuel 
consumption",,,,,,,,,,
12089," Moreover, automated driving improves safety 
because the risk of a tail-end collision as a result of driver  
inattention is significantly reduced",,,,,,,,,,

face, a typical feature of sports cars",,,,,,,,,,
12487," Above all, the battery oper-
ates with 800 volts, more than twice the figure of present- 
day electric vehicles",,,,,,,,,,

the “Mission E” can charge enough energy for a further 400

important than charging speed, which is why the batteries of 
the “Mission E” can also be replenished by induction",,,,,,,,,,
12492," A magnetic 
coil installed under the vehicle provides the power required, 
which means that the driver no longer needs to deal with a  
cumbersome charging cable",,,,,,,,,,
