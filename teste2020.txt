BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
Customer focus, enthusiasm for the product, and efficiency are the core values at  MAN. In fiscal year 2020 , MAN 
revealed its extensively upgraded truck generation, which is consistently designed to meet the changing needs 
of the transportation industry, setting the standards for assistance systems, driver orientation and digital 
connectivity. The improvements to the drivetrain, aerodynamics and the 
MAN EfficientCruise efficiency 
assistant reduce fuel consumption in the new truck generation by up to 8% compared with the previous gene-
ration. The 
MAN TGX was named International Truck of the Year 2021 by 24 industry journalists. The award is 
one of the most prestigious in the transportation industry. 
In the bus segment, the all-electric 
MAN Lion’s City 18 E optimized for urban transportation was launched 
in 2020. The 18-meter articulated bus can carry up to 120 passengers and generates zero local emissions. The 
MAN Lion’s City 18 E will begin scheduled operations in 2021 in Barcelona, Spain, and Cologne, Germany.  
MAN teamed up with partner companies during the Covid-19 pandemic to convert its  TGE model into an 
innovative diagnostic vehicle. With the molecular diagnostic 
PCR test equipment on board the  MAN TGE, the 
results of nasal or throat swabs are available in just 39 minutes. Up to 800 tests can be carried out per day and 
analyzed directly in the vehicle. 
In South America, Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus expanded its product portfolio in 2020 with its largest 
truck model to date. The Meteor is used in the heavy-duty sector, which is enjoying especially strong growth in 
the Brazilian market. In addition to the new Meteor, the successful VW Constellation model also celebrated its 
premiere with the new generation of the 13 l D26 engine. In 2021 in the field of alternative drive systems, 
Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus plans to begin with the supply of 100 “e-Delivery” electric trucks to Ambev, 
Latin America’s largest beverage company. Ambev intends to deploy the e-Delivery in São Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro starting in the second half of the year.  
Incoming orders at 
MAN Commercial Vehicles decreased in fiscal year 2020 by 11.0% year-on-year to 
123 thousand vehicles; the market decline anticipated for 2020 – especially in the EU27+3 region – was exac-
erbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. In America, 
MAN Commercial Vehicles recorded lower demand with its 
Volkswagen Caminhões e Ônibus brand, particularly in Brazil and Mexico. A total of 118 (143) thousand com-
mercial vehicles were delivered to customers, of which 11 (14) thousand were buses. 
MAN produced a total of 119 (141) thousand commercial vehicles in 2020, including 11 (14) thousand buses.  
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
Sales revenue at  MAN Commercial Vehicles decreased by 14.4% in 2020 to €10.8 billion. The operating result 
dropped to €–631 (402) million as a consequence of the pandemic. This was attributable not only to lower 
vehicle sales but also to depreciation and amortization charges, as well as additional costs incurred in 
connection with the launch of the new truck generation. Measures to achieve consistent cost savings in all 
areas were unable to compensate for this decline. The operating return on sales was –
 5.8 (3.2)%.
