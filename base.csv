60,"On behalf of the Volkswagen Group I would like to apologize to you, our shareholders, that the trust you placed in Volkswagen has been broken.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,38,,,,,,

75,Without the special items we would once again have been able to talk about a successful year overall.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,38,,,,,,
76,"In light of this and given the Group’s unchanged robust financial strength, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of €0.11 per ordinary share and €0.17 per preferred share to the Annual General Meeting of Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft despite the negative consolidated result of the Volkswagen Group.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,38,,,,,,

2149,"This was true of the testing and certification processes for the engine control units, for example, which were unsuited to pre- venting the use of the software in question.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2150,"The Group Internal Audit function proposed specific remedial measures to address the identified weaknesses, which focus on creating more clearly structured and systematic processes on the technical side.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2151,"For example, the processes and structures used for approving the software for engine control units are being reorganized with more clearly defined and binding powers and responsibilities.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2152,We have already resolved to make comprehensive changes to testing practices on the technical side as a key response to the Group Internal Audit function’s findings.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2153,"Therefore, Volkswagen has decided that in the future emissions tests, in general, will be externally evaluated by independent third parties.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2154,Real-world ran- dom tests of vehicles’ emissions behavior on the road will also be introduced.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2155,"Furthermore, the internal control system has been optimized through a new set of regulations for the procedure in control unit software development, emission classification and escalation management.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2156,"While the Group Internal Audit function has already com- pleted its analysis of the Company’s processes, the work being done by Jones Day will continue well into 2016.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2157,One reason for the different durations of the investigations is that the external inves- tigators must screen very large volumes of data.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2158,"By the end of December, over 100 terabytes of data had been secured and more than 1,500 electronic data storage devices from some 380 employees had been collected.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2159,"Moreover, the external investigation is seek- ing to establish legal responsibility for what has occurred.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2160,"This means that the findings not only need to be plausible and consist- ent with the evidence, but must also stand up in court.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2161,Employees from the affected departments have been dis- missed as a further direct consequence of the findings to date from the internal inquiries and external investigations.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2162,The information that has been viewed so far has helped trace the origin and development of the diesel issue to a large extent.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2163,The starting point was the strategic decision to launch a large-scale promotion of diesel vehicles in the USA in 2005.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2164,"To this end, a new diesel powertrain unit featuring high performance and cost-effi- cient production – the EA 189 type engine – was to be developed.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2165,The US emissions limits for emissions of pollutants are strict.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2166,"Under the strictest standard in the USA at the time, only 31 mg/km of NOX were allowed to be emitted, about six times less than under the Euro 5 standard applicable in Europe at that time.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2167,"When designing state-of-the-art diesel engines, technicians and engi- neers face the challenge that measures to reduce NOX categorically have a knock-on effect on other parameters (e.g. CO2).",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2168,"In the ensuing period, in order to resolve this conflicting objective satisfactorily within the time frame and budget of the EA 189 project, according to the current state of knowledge, a group of persons – whose identity is still being determined – at levels below the Group’s Board of Management in the powertrain development division, decided to modify the engine management software.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2169,"With this software modification, emissions values were generated in bench testing that differed substantially from those under real driving conditions.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2170,"As things stand, outside the group of persons mentioned above, the then and current Board of Management of Volkswagen AG had, at any rate, no knowledge of the use of unlawful engine man- agement software at the time.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2171,"Even after the International Council on Clean Transportation ( ICCT) study was published in May 2014, the discrepancies were initially regarded – on the basis of the facts currently known regarding the members of the Board of Manage- ment responsible at that time – as a technical problem that did not basically differ from other everyday technical problems at an automotive company.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2172,"In the exhaust measurements carried out inhouse at Volkswagen in the subsequent months, the test set-ups on which the ICCT study was based were repeated and the unusu- ally high NOX emissions confirmed.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2173,"CARB was informed of this result, and at the same time the offer was made to recalibrate the type EA 189 diesel engines as part of a service measure that was already planned in the USA.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2174,"This measure was evaluated and adopted by the Ausschuss für Produktsicherheit ( APS – product safety committee), which includes, among others, employees from the technical development, quality assurance, sales, production, logistics, procurement and legal departments, as part of the existing processes within the Volkswagen Group.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2175,The APS thus plays a central role in the internal control system at Volkswagen AG.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2176,There are currently no reliable findings to con- firm that an unlawful software modification was reported by the APS as the cause of the discrepancies to the persons responsible for preparing the 2014 annual and consolidated financial state- ments.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2177,"Instead, at the time that the annual and consolidated financial statements were being prepared, this group of people remained under the impression that the discrepancies could be eliminated with comparatively little effort as a part of a field measure.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2178,"Based on what is currently known, the actual back- ground of the discrepancies only became clear gradually to the members of the Board of Management dealing with the matter.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,
2179,"It was only reliably recognized in the summer of 2015 that the cause of the discrepancies was a software modification, to be 51 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT The Emissions Issue",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,82,,,,,,

2181,"This culminated in the disclosure of the “defeat device” to the EPA/CARB on September 3, 2015.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,83,,,,,,
2182,"According to the assessment at that time of the members of the Board of Manage- ment dealing with the matter, the scope of the costs expected as a result by the Volkswagen Group (recall costs, retrofitting costs and financial penalties), was basically not dissimilar to that of previous cases in which other vehicle manufacturers were involved, and therefore appeared to be controllable overall with a view to the business activities of the Volkswagen Group.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,83,,,,,,
2183,"This appraisal by Volkswagen AG was based on the assessment of a law firm brought in in the USA for approval issues, according to which similar cases in the past were resolved amicably with the US authorities.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,83,,,,,,

2185,"Six-cylinder diesel engines On November 2, 2015, the EPA announced that it had determined that engine management software installed in vehicles with V6 3.0 l TDI diesel engines contains “auxiliary emission control devices” ( AECDs) which had not been disclosed adequately in the US type approval process.",Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,83,,,,,,

7514,“People can decide for themselves whether they want to use their time to work or just sit back and enjoy – a bit like a business class flight with a good airline.” But with one crucial difference: you can decide at any stage dur- ing the journey to get back into the pilot’s seat.INCREASED SAFETY 90 percent of all accidents are attributable to human error.,Volkswagen Annual report 2015,2015,Volkswagen,362,,,,,,
