38," Letter to our  
Shareholders
This is the first annual report of the Volkswagen Group where I have the privilege of writing to you as Chairman of the 
Board of Management. I welcome this opportunity, although I would have preferred to be addressing you in more  
auspicious circumstances: as a result of the irregularities relating to diesel engines which contradict the very essence of 
what Volkswagen stands for, we find ourselves in the midst of what is probably the greatest challenge in the history of our 
Company. On behalf of the Volkswagen Group I would like to apologize to you, our shareholders, that the trust you placed 
in

 
Volkswagen
 
has
 
been
 
broken. 
We are doing everything we can to overcome this crisis: with effective technical solutions for our customers and trustful 
cooperation with all the responsible authorities in order to completely and transparently clarify what happened. We are 
gradually making progress. Looking to the future, we must above all learn from past mistakes and draw the right conse-
quences so that something like this can never happen at Volkswagen again. That is what is needed to rebuild trust and 
get our Group back on the right track. I realize that this course sometimes puts a great strain on patience – both yours 
and ours. But everyone at Volkswagen is working most diligently and with great commitment to rebuild the high  
esteem

 
this
 
Group
 
rightly
 
enjoyed
 
for
 
so
 
long.
The present crisis has a very significant impact on the Company. This is reflected among other things by the financial 
key performance indicators for the last fiscal year. But these figures also contain another important message: our  
operating business continues to be in excellent shape, our portfolio of twelve strong brands, unique in our industry, is 
carrying us even through this difficult phase. We delivered almost 10 million vehicles to customers in 2015 and grew 
sales revenue by over five percent to €213.3 billion. The operating result, which ran at €12.7 billion in the previous year, 
was €–4.1 billion. That is attributable to negative special items totaling €16.9 billion; without these special items, the 
operating result would have slightly exceeded the prior-year level. At €16.2 billion, the lion’s share of special items is  
accounted for by contingency reserves for the diesel issue, including ongoing technical and customer-related measures, 
repurchases and legal risks. The Volkswagen Group’s earnings before and after tax amounted to €–1.3, respectively 
€–1.4

 
billion
 
as
 a 
result
 
of
 
the
 
high
 
exceptional
 
charges.
Without the special items we would once again have been able to talk about a successful year overall. In light of this  
and given the Group’s unchanged robust financial strength, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board 
will propose a dividend of €0.11 per ordinary share and €0.17 per preferred share to the Annual General Meeting of 
Volkswagen

 
Aktiengesellschaft
 
despite
 
the
 
negative
 
consolidated
 
result
 
of
 
the
 
Volkswagen
 
Group.

commitment to rebuild the high esteem this 
Group rightly enjoyed for so long.”

8TO OUR SHAREHOLDERSLetter to our Shareholders",,,,,,,,,,
40,"The diesel issue has clearly overshadowed much in recent weeks. For me it is important that you know there is much 
more to Volkswagen than this crisis. Our Group has qualities that did not vanish overnight, qualities on which we can 
also build for the future: strong brands and great vehicles, outstanding technological expertise and innovative 
strength, our global presence, millions of loyal customers all over the world, and a skilled team that is totally committed 
to these customers. I have great respect for the achievements and dedication of our employees. We are – I am – very 
grateful for that.  
The Volkswagen Group has the firm resolve and the strength to master the difficult situation we find ourselves in with its 
own resources. From the outset, I have believed it is important we use this crisis as an opportunity: an opportunity to 
realign the Group in an automotive world that is facing epoch-making change. Our mission is to come up with the right 
answers to the big issues of the future, namely e-mobility, urbanization and digitalization. To do that, the Volkswagen 
Group must become faster and more efficient, more flexible and courageous, more technically progressive and sustain-
able in all relevant aspects. That is why we are realigning our structures, our mindset and the way we approach things. 
More than that – we are also renewing our targets, or to put it another way: we are evolving the strategy which has served 
us so well over the past years in light of the challenges to be faced over the next ten years. The presentation of our “Strategy 
2025”

 
mid-year
 
will
 
be
 
an
 
important
  
milestone. 
As far as Volkswagen is concerned, 2016 will clearly be a year of transition, a year when we lay the foundations for the 
future. I am firmly convinced that, with time, we will be able to say: no matter how grave the crisis was, it also opened 
doors for us. Because it encouraged us to set the right priorities and speed up overdue change. And because we will 
succeed in making Volkswagen a better company with the measures we are now putting in place. A Group that boldly 
seizes the future, attains sustainable growth and opens up long-term perspectives: for its customers, employees and 
partners,

 
for
 
society
 
and,
 
not
 
least,
 
for
 
you,
 
our
 
shareholders. 
A letter of this kind usually ends by asking shareholders for their trust. Now more than ever, that trust must be earned. 
And we are working on that. Which is why, this year, I am asking above all for your continued loyalty to Volkswagen in 
spite

 
of
 
the
 
present
 
pressures,
 
and
 
hope
 
you
 
remain
 
at
 
our
 
side
 
as
 
we
 
make
 
the
 
journey
 
into
 
the
 future. 
Sincerely, 
Matthias Müller

43," Report of the  
Supervisory Board


 (IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 171(2) OF THE AKTG)
Ladies and Gentlemen,
2015 was a very eventful year for the Volkswagen Group. The events surrounding the emissions issue and changes in the 
composition of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management meant that 2015 was also an unprecedented year 
in terms of the work of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG therefore addressed the Com-
pany’s position and development regularly and in greater breadth and depth than ever before. We supported and super-
vised the Board of Management in its running of the business and advised it on issues relating to the management of the 
Company in accordance with our duties under the law, the Articles of Association and the rules of procedure. We also 
observed the relevant recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code at all times. The 
Supervisory Board was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental importance to the Group. We also discussed 
strategic

 
considerations
 
with
 
the
 
Board
 
of
 
Management
 
at
 
regular
 
intervals.
The Board of Management regularly, promptly and comprehensively informed the Supervisory Board in writing or 
orally on the development of the business and the Company’s planning and position, including the risk situation and 
risk management. In addition, the Board of Management reported to the Supervisory Board on an ongoing basis on 
compliance-related topics and other topical issues. In all cases we received the documents relevant to our decisions in 
good time for our meetings. We also received a detailed monthly report from the Board of Management on the current 
business position and the forecast for the current year. Any variances in performance that occurred as against the plans 
and targets previously drawn up were explained by the Board of Management in detail, either orally or in writing. We 
analyzed the reasons for the variances together with the Board of Management so as to enable countermeasures to be 
derived. In addition, the Board of Management presented regular reports on current developments in connection with 
the

 
emissions
 issue 
at
 
the
 
meetings
 
of
 
the
 
Special
 
Committee
  
on
 
Diesel
 
Engines.
The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board consulted with the Chairman of the Board of Man-
agement at regular intervals between meetings to discuss important current issues such as the Volkswagen Group’s 
strategy and planning, the development of the business, the Group’s risk situation and risk management including com-
pliance

 issues, 
as
 
well
 
as
 
developments
 
in
 
the
 
diesel
 
and
 
CO2 issues 
from
 
September
 
2015
 
onwards.
The Supervisory Board held a total of eight meetings in fiscal year 2015. The average attendance ratio was 95.0%; with 
the exception of Mr. Akbar Al Baker, all of the members of the Supervisory Board attended over half of the meetings of 
the Supervisory Board and the committees of which they are members. In addition, resolutions on urgent matters were 
adopted

 
in
 
writing
  
or
 
using
 
electronic
 
communications
 media.
COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
The Supervisory Board has established five committees in order to perform the duties entrusted to it: the Executive 
Committee, the Nomination Committee, the Mediation Committee in accordance with section 27(3) of the Mitbestim-
mungsgesetz (MitbestG – German Codetermination Act), the Audit Committee and, since October 2015, the Special 
Committee on Diesel Engines. The Executive Committee and the Special Committee on Diesel Engines each consist of 
three shareholder representatives and three employee representatives. The members of the Nomination Committee 
are the shareholder representatives on the Executive Committee. The remaining two committees are each composed of 
12TO OUR SHAREHOLDERSReport of the Supervisory Board",,,,,,,,,,
44,"two shareholder representatives and two employee representatives. The members of these committees as of December 
31,

 
2015
 
are
 
given
 
on
 
page
 
84
 
of
 
this
 
annual
 
report. 
The Executive Committee met twelve times during the past fiscal year. As well as discussing the composition of the 
Board of Management, these meetings primarily served to prepare in detail the resolutions by the Supervisory Board 
and to deal with contractual issues concerning the Board of Management other than remuneration. In addition, the 
Executive

 
Committee
  
addressed
 
the
 
events
 
relating
 
to
 
the
 
emissions
 issue 
in
 
detail
 
as
 
from
 
September
 
2015.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for proposing suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board to recommend 
for

 
election
 
to
 
the
 
Annual
 
General
 
Meeting.
 
The
 
Committee
  met 
three
 times 
in
 
the
 
reporting
 
period.
The

 
Mediation
 
Committee
  
did
 
not
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
convened
 
in
 
2015.
The Audit Committee held six meetings in fiscal year 2015. It focused primarily on the consolidated financial state-
ments, risk management (including the internal control system), and the work performed by the Company’s compliance 
organization. In addition, the Audit Committee addressed the Group’s quarterly reports and the half-yearly financial 
report

 
as
 
well
 
as
 
current
 financial 
reporting
 issues 
and
 
their
 
examination
 
by
 
the
 auditors. 
The Special Committee on Diesel Engines is responsible for coordinating all activities relating to the emissions issue. In 
particular, the Special Committee is tasked with reviewing the progress being made with the internal investigations. It 
also receives regular reports from the Board of Management about the latest developments. Finally, it is entrusted with 
examining any consequences of the findings. The Special Committee on Diesel Engines met on six occasions in fiscal 
year

 
2015
 
following
 
its
 
establishment
 
October
 
7,
 
2015.
Furthermore, as a rule the shareholder and employee representatives met for separate preliminary discussions before 
each

 
of
 
the
 
Supervisory
 
Board
 
meetings.
TOPICS DISCUSSED BY THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
At the Supervisory Board meeting on February 27, 2015 following a detailed examination we approved the consolidated 
financial statements and the annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG for 2014 prepared by the Board of Man-
agement, as well as the combined management report. We also examined the dependent company report submitted by 
the Board of Management and came to the conclusion that there were no objections to be raised to the concluding decla-
ration by the Board of Management in the report. Another agenda item was the remuneration system for the Board of 
Management. We also addressed the future structure and direction of the commercial vehicles business. In addition, 
we appointed Mr. Matthias Müller and Dr. Herbert Diess to the Group’s Board of Management effective March 1, 2015 
and

 
July
 
1,
 
2015,
 
respectively.
Two Supervisory Board meetings were held on May 4 and 5, 2015 in the context of Volkswagen AG’s 2015 Annual Gener-
al Meeting. These meetings focused on preparations for and the post-completion analysis of the 55th Annual General 
Meeting of Volkswagen AG on May 5, 2015. We also approved the creation of the integrated commercial vehicles group 
and the establishment of Truck & Bus GmbH as a new holding company for the 
MAN and Scania commercial vehicles 
brands.
At the Supervisory Board meeting on September 25, 2015, we addressed in detail the information available at the time 
on the irregularities discovered in relation to the nitrogen oxide emissions of certain diesel engines and discussed the 
establishment of the Special Committee on Diesel Engines. We also adopted resolutions to restructure the Company, 
including a new management structure in the Volkswagen Group and its brands, as well as in the North American re-
gion, which started being implemented in early 2016. We accepted Prof. Dr. Martin Winterkorn’s offer to step down as 
Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG. We appointed Mr. Matthias Müller as Chairman of the Board 
of Management of Volkswagen AG and resolved on other issues relating to the composition of the Board of Management. 
The Supervisory Board also defined a target quota for the Board of Management in accordance with the Gesetz für die 
gleichberechtigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungspositionen in der Privatwirtschaft und im öffent- 
lichen Dienst (Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private and Public 
13TO OUR SHAREHOLDERSReport of the Supervisory Board",,,,,,,,,,
45,"Sectors): the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG set itself the long-term goal of increasing the proportion of female 
members on the Board of Management to 30%. Further information on this topic is contained in the Corporate Govern-
ance
 
Report
 
on
 
page
 
63.
The Supervisory Board meeting on October 7, 2015 focused on the current state of affairs with respect to the diesel

AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Annual General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on May 5, 2015 elected PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as auditors for fiscal year 2015, in line with our proposal. The auditors audited the 
annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Volkswagen Group and the 
combined

 
management
 
report,
  
and
 issued 
unqualified
 
audit
 
reports
 
in
 
each
 case. 
In addition, they analyzed the risk management and internal control systems, concluding that the Board of Manage-
ment had taken the measures required by section 91(2) of the AktG to ensure early detection of any risks endangering 
the continued existence of the Company. The Report by Volkswagen AG on Relationships with Affiliated Companies in 
Accordance with Section 312 of the AktG for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015 (dependent company 
16TO OUR SHAREHOLDERSReport of the Supervisory Board",,,,,,,,,,
48,"report) submitted by the Board of Management was also audited by the auditors, who issued the following opinion: “In 
our opinion and in accordance with our statutory audit, we certify that the factual disclosures provided in the report are 
correct and that the Company’s consideration concerning legal transactions referred to in the report was not unduly 
high.” 
The members of the Audit Committee and the members of the Supervisory Board were provided in each case with the 
documentation relating to the annual financial statements, including the dependent company report, and the audit 
reports prepared by the auditors in good time for their meetings on April 21, 2016 and April 22, 2016 respectively. The 
auditors reported extensively at both meetings on the material findings of their audit and were available to provide addi-
tional

 
information.
Taking into consideration the audit reports and the discussion with the auditors and based on its own conclusions, the 
Audit Committee prepared the documents for the Supervisory Board’s examination of the consolidated financial state-
ments, the annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG, the combined management report and the dependent com-
pany report and reported on these at the Supervisory Board meeting on April 22, 2016. Following this, the Audit Com-
mittee recommended that the Supervisory Board approve the annual financial statements. We examined the documents 
in depth in the knowledge and on the basis of the report by the Audit Committee and the audit report as well as in talks 
and discussions with the auditors. We came to the conclusion that they are due and proper and that the assessment of the 
position of the Company and the Group presented by the Board of Management in the management report corresponds 
to the assessment by the Supervisory Board. We therefore concurred with the auditors’ findings and approved the annu-
al financial statements prepared by the Board of Management and the consolidated financial statements at our meeting 
on April 22, 2016, at which the auditors also took part in discussions on the agenda items relating to the financial state-
ments. The annual financial statements are thus adopted. Our examination of the dependent company report did not 
result in any objections to the concluding declaration by the Board of Management in the dependent company report. 
We reviewed the proposal on the appropriation of net profit submitted by the Board of Management, taking into account 
in

 
particular
  
the
 
interests
 
of
 
the
 
Company
 
and
 
its
 
shareholders,
 
and
 
endorsed
 
the
 
proposal.
The events surrounding the emissions issue have affected us all very deeply. Volkswagen does not tolerate any breaches 
of the law or other irregularities. The misconduct uncovered in fiscal year 2015 runs contrary to all of the values that 
Volkswagen stands for. The trust of our customers and the public is and will remain our most important asset. We are 
sincerely sorry for betraying this trust. We will spare no effort in restoring full confidence. The Supervisory Board has 
already initiated extensive measures in order to comprehensively
 
address
 
the
 issue.
We would like to thank the members of the Board of Management, the Works Council, the management and all the 
employees of Volkswagen AG and its affiliated companies, and express our particular appreciation for their work in 
2015.

 
Their
 
great
 fortitude 
and
 
loyalty
 
have
 
been
 a 
source
 
of
 
strength
 
for
 
Volkswagen
 
in

 time.

In this chapter, we present the key volume and financial data relating to the Group brands and to Volkswagen Financial 
Services. In light of the considerable importance of the development of business in China for the Volkswagen Group and 
the continuing growth in the world’s largest single market, we also report on business developments and the results of our 
activities in China in this chapter.  
The production figures and deliveries to customers are presented separately by brand and their models, i.e. by product 
line. Unit sales figures refer to models sold by the various brand companies, including vehicles of other Group brands. In 
some cases, there are marked differences between delivery figures and unit sales as a result of our business development 
in China. 
In addition, we explain unit sales and sales revenue in the Europe/Other markets, North America, South America and 
Asia-Pacific markets. 
KEY FIGURES BY MARKET 
The irregularities that emerged in relation to the software used in certain diesel engines of the Volkswagen Group and the 
irregularities in relation to CO
2 emissions that could not be ruled out initially impacted the Volkswagen Group starting in 
September of last year. In particular, expenses for technical modifications, repurchases and legal risks arising in connec-
tion with the diesel issue led to the recognition of special items of €–16.9 billion in total. Operating result before special 
items matched the prior-year level at €12.8 billion. 
The Volkswagen Group operated in a continuously challenging market environment in fiscal year 2015, facing fierce 
competition. Unit sales passed the ten million mark again, at 10.0 (10.2) million vehicles, while sales revenue rose by 5.4% 
to €213.3 billion. 
In the Europe/Other markets region, unit sales of Group models increased 2.1% to 4.5 million vehicles in the 
reporting period. Sales revenue was up 7.9% year-on-year to €132.5 billion on the back of volume, mix and exchange rate 
effects. 
The Group sold 0.9 million units in North America; 7.0% more than in the year before. Sales revenue increased 28.1% 
to €35.4 billion, primarily due to the increase in volumes, the stronger US dollar and positive mix effects. 
With the economic environment in the South American region continuing to deteriorate, demand for vehicles fell 
again in the reporting period. The Volkswagen Group sold 0.5 million vehicles there (–32.0%). Sales revenue decreased by 
26.8% to €10.1 billion as a consequence of lower sales figures and negative exchange rate effects. 
Demand for Group models in the Asia-Pacific markets in fiscal year 2015 was slightly lower than in the previous year. 
Including the Chinese joint ventures, 4.0 (4.1) million vehicles were sold there. Sales revenue fell by 7.6% to €35.2 billion 
due to volume-related factors. These figures do not include the sales revenue generated by our Chinese joint ventures, 
since these are accounted for using the equity method.

The irregularities that emerged in relation to the software used in certain diesel engines of the Volkswagen Group and the 
irregularities in relation to CO
2 emissions that could not be ruled out initially impacted the Volkswagen Group starting in 
September of last year. In particular, expenses for technical modifications, repurchases and legal risks arising in connec-
tion with the diesel issue led to the recognition of special items of €–16.9 billion in total. Operating result before special 
items matched the prior-year level at €12.8 billion. 
The Volkswagen Group operated in a continuously challenging market environment in fiscal year 2015, facing fierce 
competition. Unit sales passed the ten million mark again, at 10.0 (10.2) million vehicles, while sales revenue rose by 5.4% 
to €213.3 billion. 
In the Europe/Other markets region, unit sales of Group models increased 2.1% to 4.5 million vehicles in the 
reporting period. Sales revenue was up 7.9% year-on-year to €132.5 billion on the back of volume, mix and exchange rate 
effects. 
The Group sold 0.9 million units in North America; 7.0% more than in the year before. Sales revenue increased 28.1% 
to €35.4 billion, primarily due to the increase in volumes, the stronger US dollar and positive mix effects. 
With the economic environment in the South American region continuing to deteriorate, demand for vehicles fell 
again in the reporting period. The Volkswagen Group sold 0.5 million vehicles there (–32.0%). Sales revenue decreased by 
26.8% to €10.1 billion as a consequence of lower sales figures and negative exchange rate effects. 
Demand for Group models in the Asia-Pacific markets in fiscal year 2015 was slightly lower than in the previous year. 
Including the Chinese joint ventures, 4.0 (4.1) million vehicles were sold there. Sales revenue fell by 7.6% to €35.2 billion 
due to volume-related factors. These figures do not include the sales revenue generated by our Chinese joint ventures, 
since these are accounted for using the equity method.

22 In this chapter, we present the key volume and financial data relating to the Group brands and to Volkswagen Financial 
Services. In light of the considerable importance of the development of business in China for the Volkswagen Group and 
the continuing growth in the world’s largest single market, we also report on business developments and the results of our 
activities in China in this chapter.  
The production figures and deliveries to customers are presented separately by brand and their models, i.e. by product 
line. Unit sales figures refer to models sold by the various brand companies, including vehicles of other Group brands. In 
some cases, there are marked differences between delivery figures and unit sales as a result of our business development 
in China. 
In addition, we explain unit sales and sales revenue in the Europe/Other markets, North America, South America and 
Asia-Pacific markets.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand launched the third generation of the Touran in 2015. The family-friendly compact 
van scores points with a highly variable interior, an economical range of engines and an extensive lineup of driver 
assistance and infotainment systems. The Passat 
GTE expanded the range of plug-in hybrid vehicles. At the  IAA in Frankfurt 
am Main, the new Tiguan attracted interest from visitors; the launch takes place in the second quarter of 2016. The 
successful Polo celebrated its 40th birthday in the reporting period; the first one rolled off the production line in Wolfsburg 
in spring 1975. The emissions issue has negatively impacted the brand since September 2015. 
In a continuously challenging market environment, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand delivered 5.8 million 
vehicles in the reporting period. The decrease of 4.8% year-on-year was attributable in particular to the markets in Brazil, 
China and Russia. Vehicle sales in Europe, particularly in Spain (+13.2%) and Italy (+5.8%), as well as in Turkey (+26.9%) 
and Mexico (+11.8%) were encouraging.  
At 4.4 (4.6) million vehicles, unit sales by the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand were lower in 2015 than in 2014. In 
Brazil and Russia, demand fell again due to the tense market situation; in Western Europe, by contrast, it continued to 
recover. There was strong customer demand for the Golf, the Sportsvan and the new generation of the Passat in particular. 
The difference between deliveries and unit sales is mainly due to the fact that the vehicle-producing joint ventures in China 
are not counted as Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand companies. 
The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand produced 5.9 million vehicles in the reporting period and thus 4.2% fewer 
than in the previous year. In Wolfsburg, the 43 millionth vehicle rolled off the production line in 2015, while the Emden 
plant celebrated the production of its 11 millionth vehicle. In 2015, Volkswagen became the first foreign automobile 
manufacturer to open its own engine plant in Russia. The plant is located in Kaluga in direct proximity to the vehicle 
production facilities and has an annual capacity of 150,000 units. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
At €106.2 billion in the reporting period, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s sales revenue was 6.5% higher than the 
figure for the previous year. Operating result before special items decreased to €2.1 (2.5) billion. Positive effects from 
exchange rates, from sales revenue and cost optimization and from the efficiency program were unable to offset negative 
impacts from the markets in Brazil and Russia as well as market-related promotion activities resulting from the emissions

The Polo success story  

 

In fiscal year 2015, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand launched the new generation of 
the versatile Touran and presented the Tiguan’s successor. The emissions issue resulted in 
special items influencing the operating result.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand launched the third generation of the Touran in 2015. The family-friendly compact 
van scores points with a highly variable interior, an economical range of engines and an extensive lineup of driver 
assistance and infotainment systems. The Passat 
GTE expanded the range of plug-in hybrid vehicles. At the  IAA in Frankfurt 
am Main, the new Tiguan attracted interest from visitors; the launch takes place in the second quarter of 2016. The 
successful Polo celebrated its 40th birthday in the reporting period; the first one rolled off the production line in Wolfsburg 
in spring 1975. The emissions issue has negatively impacted the brand since September 2015. 
In a continuously challenging market environment, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand delivered 5.8 million 
vehicles in the reporting period. The decrease of 4.8% year-on-year was attributable in particular to the markets in Brazil, 
China and Russia. Vehicle sales in Europe, particularly in Spain (+13.2%) and Italy (+5.8%), as well as in Turkey (+26.9%) 
and Mexico (+11.8%) were encouraging.  
At 4.4 (4.6) million vehicles, unit sales by the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand were lower in 2015 than in 2014. In 
Brazil and Russia, demand fell again due to the tense market situation; in Western Europe, by contrast, it continued to 
recover. There was strong customer demand for the Golf, the Sportsvan and the new generation of the Passat in particular. 
The difference between deliveries and unit sales is mainly due to the fact that the vehicle-producing joint ventures in China 
are not counted as Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand companies. 
The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand produced 5.9 million vehicles in the reporting period and thus 4.2% fewer 
than in the previous year. In Wolfsburg, the 43 millionth vehicle rolled off the production line in 2015, while the Emden 
plant celebrated the production of its 11 millionth vehicle. In 2015, Volkswagen became the first foreign automobile 
manufacturer to open its own engine plant in Russia. The plant is located in Kaluga in direct proximity to the vehicle 
production facilities and has an annual capacity of 150,000 units. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
At €106.2 billion in the reporting period, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s sales revenue was 6.5% higher than the 
figure for the previous year. Operating result before special items decreased to €2.1 (2.5) billion. Positive effects from 
exchange rates, from sales revenue and cost optimization and from the efficiency program were unable to offset negative 
impacts from the markets in Brazil and Russia as well as market-related promotion activities resulting from the emissions 
issue. The operating return on sales before special items fell to 2.0 (2.5)%. Special items totaling €–16.4 billion resulted 
from the diesel issue, the restructuring measures in South America and the replacement of supplied airbags.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
In 2015, the Audi brand unveiled the new generation of its bestselling Audi A4, which boasts innovative technology 
highlights and underscores the brand’s leadership claim in the premium segment. The brand with the four rings also 
raised the bar with the second generation of the Audi Q7. This large 
SUV excels with new solutions in all areas of technology 
– lightweight engineering, drive technology, suspension technology, infotainment and driver assistance systems. The Audi 
Q7 e-tron quattro, which was also presented in 2015, is the first Q-series model with a plug-in hybrid drive and the world’s 
first hybrid with a six-cylinder diesel engine and permanent four-wheel drive.  
The Audi brand delivered 1.8 million vehicles in fiscal year 2015 (+3.6%), setting a new sales record. Growth was 
particularly high in Spain (+16.5%), Italy (+10.3%) and the 
USA (+11.1%). 
The Audi brand sold 1.5 million vehicles last year, up 5.9% year-on-year. In addition, a further 510 thousand Audi 
vehicles were sold by the 
FAW-Volkswagen Chinese joint venture. There was particularly strong demand for the A3 series 
and the revamped Audi A6, as well as the Q3, Q5 and Q7 
SUVs. Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. increased its unit sales to 
3,433 vehicles, compared with 2,521 vehicles in the previous year. The models from the Huracán series were especially 
well received by customers. 
A total of 1.8 million Audi models were produced worldwide in fiscal year 2015, 1.5% more vehicles than in the 
previous year. The new plant in San José Chiapa, Mexico, will start series production in mid-2016 with planned capacity of 
150,000 vehicles per year. Lamborghini produced 3,707 (2,650) vehicles. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
The Audi brand recorded sales revenue of €58.4 billion in 2015, an increase of €4.6 billion year-on-year. Operating result 
before special items was on a par with the prior-year level, at €5.1 (5.2) billion. In addition to growth in unit sales, a 
favorable mix and exchange rate trends had a positive effect. High upfront expenditures for new products and technologies 
and the expansion of the international production network had a negative impact on earnings. The brand’s operating 
return on sales before special items amounted to 8.8 (9.6)%. The diesel issue, in particular, led to special items of  
€–0.3 billion. The financial key performance indicators for the Lamborghini and Ducati brands are included in the 
financial figures for the Audi brand.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
In 2015, ŠKODA entered its 120th year of business. The company is one of the oldest automotive manufacturers in the 
world. Last year, the Czech brand remained on its successful course and continued its model rollout. It presented its 
redesigned flagship model, the new Superb. The vehicle features modern, expressive and emotional styling, as well as 
being the most spacious model in its segment. 
ŠKODA continues to focus on growth: the automatic transmission pro-
duction capacity in the Vrchlabí plant is being increased from 1,500 to 2,000 units per day. The engine center that opened 
at the company’s base in Mladá Boleslav in 2014 is being expanded through the addition of a new emissions center that will 
help to further reduce the emissions of future models; the opening is planned for mid-2016. 
ŠKODA also announced that it 
would complete the expansion and modernization of its vehicle production facility in Kvasiny by 2018. 
The 
ŠKODA brand’s deliveries to customers worldwide in 2015 totaled 1.1 million vehicles (+1.8%), which was 
another record figure. China remained the brand’s largest single market. 
ŠKODA exhibited clear growth in Central and 
Western Europe, particularly in Spain (+23.5%), the Czech Republic (+21.1%) and Italy (+16.8%), as well as in Turkey 
(+58.4%). 
ŠKODA’s unit sales in the reporting period slightly exceeded the previous year’s level at 800 (796) thousand vehicles. In 
particular, there was strong demand for the new Fabia and the models in the Octavia family. The difference between 
figures for deliveries and unit sales is mainly due to the fact that the vehicle-producing joint ventures in China are not 
counted as 
ŠKODA brand companies. 
In 2015, the 
ŠKODA brand produced 1,037 (1,050) thousand units worldwide across seven series. The 17 millionth 
vehicle manufactured by 
ŠKODA rolled off the production line at the company’s base in Mladá Boleslav in the reporting 
period. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
The ŠKODA brand’s sales revenue increased by 6.2% to €12.5 billion last year. The 11.9% increase in operating result to 
€915 million is primarily attributable to positive volume and mix effects, optimized material costs and more advantageous 
exchange rates. The operating return on sales rose from 7.0% in the previous year to 7.3%.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
The SEAT brand had a successful year in 2015, unveiling new models that were enthusiastically received by customers. The 
CONNECT special editions are available in all series and offer connectivity at the highest level. With the latest generation of 
the infotainment systems, the 
SEAT Full Link connection and the exclusive  SEAT ConnectApp, which is already pre-
installed on the smartphone delivered with the vehicle, the vehicles connect to the latest media technology with intuitive 
operation and a high level of safety. Emotional design, superior performance and the latest technology are combined in the 
new Ibiza Cupra – that is how one of the most dynamic vehicles in the compact class was created. The 
SEAT 20V20 show car 
presented in the reporting period systematically enhances the Spanish brand’s recognized design language; it combines 
the dynamic lines of a sport coupé with the imposing presence of an 
SUV and the flexibility of a mid-range estate. The 
successful concept car is rounded off by an intelligent lightweight design, a diverse range of drive technologies, numerous 
driver assistance systems and an innovative cockpit. 
The 
SEAT brand’s deliveries to customers increased by 2.4% to 400 thousand vehicles in fiscal year 2015. Sales 
increased in almost all markets, in Western Europe particularly in Italy (+22.1%) and Spain (+14.3%), in Central Europe 
particularly in the Czech Republic (+16.6%) and Poland (+16.2%). The Ibiza, Leon ST and Alhambra models were 
especially popular with customers.  
The 
SEAT brand sold 544 thousand vehicles in the reporting period, which was 8.4% more than a year earlier. The Q3 
produced for Audi is included in this figure.  
In 2015, 
SEAT produced 415 thousand vehicles, exceeding the previous year’s figure by 5.1%. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
The SEAT brand generated sales revenue of €8.6 billion in fiscal year 2015, an increase of 11.3% year-on-year. At €–  10  
(–
 127) million in the reporting period, operating result showed a marked improvement. This was primarily due to increased 
volumes, positive exchange rate effects and cost optimization. The operating return on sales improved to –
 0.1 (– 1.6)%.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
In 2015, Bentley launched the revamped Continental GT with enhanced design and technology. Redesigned bumpers and 
more clearly outlined fenders lend the Grand Tourer an even more confident appearance; in addition, its dynamic  
W12 twin turbo engine has been re-engineered. In the luxurious interior, the occupants can now use their mobile devices 
to access the Internet via the vehicle’s own 
WI-FI hotspot. Furthermore, production of the new Bentayga model began in 
the reporting period. The Bentayga is the Group’s first luxury 
SUV and propels the SUV segment into new territory. The 
Bentayga has a powerful 12-cylinder 
TSI engine with 447 kW (608 PS) under the bonnet, giving it a top speed of 301 km/h. 
Drivers can choose from four on-road and four off-road modes depending on the surface. Making its world debut in the 
Bentayga is an electronic active roll stabilization system that gives the 
SUV optimum comfort with maximum driving 
stability. 
The Bentley brand’s deliveries to customers in 2015 totaled 10,100 (11,020) vehicles and thus exceeded the 10,000 
mark for the third year in a row. The 
USA remains the largest single market for Bentley – more than one-quarter of vehicles 
were delivered there. The brand saw growth in Western Europe (+8.6%) and Japan (+15.4%).  
Bentley sold 10,616 vehicles worldwide in the reporting period; that was 2.9% fewer than in the year before. The 
Continental GT and Mulsanne models were in greater demand than in 2014. 
Production at the Bentley brand fell by 1.3% year-on-year in 2015 to 10,888 vehicles. Production of the Bentayga 
commenced at the company’s base in Crewe. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
At €1.9 billion, Bentley’s sales revenue in the reporting period was up 10.9% on the prior-year figure. Operating result, by 
contrast, decreased 34.9% to €110 million. Positive exchange rate effects and cost reductions were unable to compensate 
for the impact of lower volumes and increased upfront expenditures for new products. The operating return on sales was 
5.7 (9.7)%.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
In 2015 Porsche continued its growth path and underscored its commitment to purist sports cars. The Cayman GT4 is the 
first member of the GT family to be based on the mid-engine coupé. Following tradition, the new 911 GT3 RS is the top 
model in Porsche’s GT family and marks the highest stage of development for street-legal sports cars. The successor of the 
911 Carrera – one of the most popular sports cars for decades – now features new turbocharged engines, optimized 
suspension and a completely new Porsche Communication Management system with online navigation. The Mission E 
concept study unveiled in 2015 shows Porsche’s vision of the electric sports car of the future. The four-door car with four-
wheel drive features an emotional design and offers the familiar Porsche driving dynamics. In May 2015, Porsche opened 
its new headquarters for North America in Atlanta: the customer experience center “One Porsche Drive”. Porsche 
continued its impressive series of victories in motor sport in 2015 with its overall victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race 
and titles for the manufacturer and driver in the 
FIA World Endurance Championship. In the process, it successfully 
proved the development of promising technologies for later use on the road. 
The Porsche brand’s deliveries to customers increased by 18.6% to 225 thousand sports cars in the reporting period. 
With 58,009 vehicles (+23.6%), China became the brand’s largest single market for the first time, thus superseding the 
USA, where Porsche delivered 51,756 units (+10.1%). 
Porsche sold 219 thousand vehicles last year, 17.0% more than in 2014. The Macan, the Cayenne and the 911 were 
highly popular with customers. 
Production at the Porsche brand rose by 15.5% in 2015 to 234 thousand vehicles. Alongside the Cayenne and 
Panamera model series, the Macan has also been manufactured at the Leipzig plant since 2014. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
The Porsche brand continued its success story in fiscal year 2015. At €21.5 (17.2) billion, sales revenue was up 25.2% 
versus 2014. Operating result also rose by 25.2% to €3.4 billion due to higher volumes and more favorable exchange rates. 
An unfavorable mix, increased structural costs and higher development costs for future projects and technologies were 
systematically countered by stringent income and cost management, which kept the operating return on sales stable year-
on-year at 15.8%. 
The key figures presented here cover both the Automotive and Financial Services businesses.

Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
36 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT Hardly any other vehicle is spoken of as fondly as the ""Bulli"" from Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. The T series (Multivan/ 
Transporter), which has sold around 12 million units to date, celebrated its 65th anniversary in 2015. In keeping with this, 
the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand unveiled a new version of its successful model last year. The sixth T generation 
was launched with major technical innovations that ensure greater safety, comfort and an improved driving experience 
together with lower fuel consumption and emissions. It also features driver assistance systems such as City Emergency 
Brake, Adaptive Dynamic Chassis Control and a radio navigation system that is fitted with a proximity sensor and mobile 
online services. In addition, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles presented the fourth generation of the Caddy – one of the 
most successful urban delivery vans. The Caddy likewise boasts a multitude of new safety and comfort features, as well as 
driver assistance systems. The natural-gas-powered Caddy 
TGI was introduced as the successor to the Caddy EcoFuel. On a 
100 km stretch of road, it uses up to 1.7 kg less gas than its predecessor.  
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles delivered 431 thousand vehicles to customers in 2015, 3.5% fewer than in the previ-
ous year. Deliveries in Western Europe were down slightly on the 2014 figure (–2.5%), but rose by 26.7% in the Middle East.  
Unit sales increased by 3.0% in 2015 to 456 thousand vehicles. 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles produced 410 thousand vehicles in 2015, up 3.6% year-on-year. The Crafter pro-
duced at a contractual partner’s plants is not included in these figures. The next generation of the Crafter will roll off the 
production line at the new Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles plant in Wrzesnia, Poland, from the second half of 2016. The 
plant in Hanover produced 176 (169) thousand units of the Amarok, Caravelle/Multivan and Transporter last year. The 
plant in Poznan manufactured 171 (176) thousand units of the Caddy and T5. Production of the Amarok in South America 
increased, driven by exports. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles generated sales revenue of €10.3 (9.6) billion in fiscal year 2015. Operating result before 
special items decreased by 24.2% year-on-year to €382 million. Higher expenditures for the renewal of the product 
portfolio were offset by positive effects from the increase in unit sales and improvements in exchange rates. The operating 
return on sales before special items decreased in the reporting period from 5.3% to 3.7%.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
The Swedish Scania brand boosted its position in 2015 as the truck manufacturer with the most comprehensive offering of 
engines for alternative fuels. The new bioethanol engine is the first that meets the requirements of the Euro 6 standard. 
With the P 280 Scania launched the fourth generation of trucks powered by this type of fuel. In addition, Scania presented 
a hybrid truck for urban use, which can operate solely on electric power or on renewable biofuels; it also meets the Euro 6 
emission standard. Scania’s Fleet Management Services, a telematic service integrated into the vehicle, is another 
example of sustainable logistics services. The system, which won the German Telematics Award in 2015, can help reduce 
fuel consumption by up to 10%.  
The key figures presented in this chapter comprise Scania’s Trucks and Buses, Industrial and Marine Engines, and 
Financial Services businesses. 
In Europe, the commercial vehicle business grew in 2015 compared with the previous year, in which business had 
been adversely affected by the introduction of the Euro 6 emission standard. The situation in Brazil and Russia worsened 
in the reporting period as a result of a further sharp drop in demand. 
In fiscal year 2015, orders received by the Scania brand decreased by 7.1% to 77 thousand vehicles. In Western 
Europe, however, orders were up on 2014; this is primarily due to Scania’s leading position in Euro 6 engines, its many 
years of experience with consumption-optimized vehicles and its wide range of alternative drive systems. Deliveries world-
wide decreased to 77 (80) thousand vehicles. The growth and market share increases in Europe were unable to compensate 
for the considerable declines in Brazil and Russia, however. Bus deliveries were on a par with the previous year, 
amounting to 7 (7) thousand units; demand for services and replacement parts, on the other hand, increased significantly. 
The healthy growth of Scania Financial Services continued in 2015. 
In 2015, the Scania brand produced 79 (82) thousand commercial vehicles (– 3.5%), including 7 (7) thousand buses. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
The Scania brand generated sales revenue of €10.5 (10.4) billion in 2015, up slightly on the previous year. Operating result 
improved to €1,027 (955) million; the expansion of the service business and exchange rates had a positive effect. The 
brand’s operating return on sales increased in fiscal year 2015 to 9.8 (9.2)%.

Operating result in 2015

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 
The MAN truck and bus production story began 100 years ago. On June 21, 1915, “Lastwagenwerke M.A.N.-Saurer” was 
entered in the City of Nuremberg’s commercial register. 
MAN produced a real highlight to mark the anniversary: the  TGX 
D38 “100 Years Edition” impresses with both its equipment features and its strong and efficient engines. In 2015, 
MAN 
launched a comprehensive program for the future to strengthen the company in the competitive environment. It covers all 
key areas of the company and has a particular focus on restructuring the production locations and streamlining all areas of 
administration. The Power Engineering Business Area completed a power station on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe 
in 2015. In China and Norway, state-of-the-art plants with compressors from 
MAN were inaugurated.  
The key figures presented in this chapter comprise the Trucks and Buses businesses and the Power Engineering 
Business Area. 
The economic environment remained difficult for 
MAN in fiscal year 2015. While the Western and Central European 
commercial vehicle market, buoyed by the positive economic momentum, recorded encouraging growth, demand in 
Russia and South America was lower than the already weak level of the previous year. Orders received decreased by 11.7% 
overall to 108 thousand vehicles. 
MAN delivered 102 thousand commercial vehicles, 14.7% fewer than in the previous 
year, of which 10 (14) thousand were buses.  
MAN produced 101 (116) thousand commercial vehicles in the reporting period, of which 10 (12) thousand were buses. 
The Munich plant, which is currently being expanded with a modern and efficient cab paint shop, reached its 60th 
anniversary in the reporting period. 
In the year under review, orders received in the Power Engineering Business Area fell to €3.4 (3.9) billion. In addition 
to the still difficult situation in the shipping industry, economic development in emerging markets and developing 
countries and the low oil price inhibited business. 
SALES REVENUE AND EARNINGS 
The MAN brand’s sales revenue decreased by 4.1% to €13.7 billion in 2015, of which €3.8 (3.7) billion was attributable to 
the Power Engineering segment. Operating result before special items was €277 (384) million. The operating return on 
sales before special items amounted to 2.0 (2.7)%. Restructuring measures resulted in special items of €–0.2 billion.

Volkswagen Group China 
42 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT Volkswagen opened a new vehicle plant in Changsha, southern China, in May 2015. The facility has the capacity to produce 
a total of 300,000 Volkswagen Passenger Cars and 
ŠKODA brand models per year. More than 4,000 jobs are expected to be 
created at the plant, with a further 4,000 at the adjacent supplier park. The plant is the 
SAIC VOLKSWAGEN  (formerly 
Shanghai-Volkswagen) joint venture’s first production facility to receive the “Triple-Star Green Building Design Award”, 
China’s highest state award for environmentally friendly factory planning. Vehicles and components are currently 
manufactured at a total of 20 locations in China. There are also plans for two new vehicle plants in Qingdao and Tianjin on 
China’s east coast. These will be constructed in cooperation with our joint venture partner 
FAW and will manufacture 
environmentally friendly models. We intend to gradually expand capacity in China to around five million vehicles per year 
by 2020. The joint ventures will maintain a stable level of investment in 2016 of around €4 billion. These investments will 
be financed by the joint ventures from their own funds. 
We continued our e-mobility initiative in China with the launch of the Golf 
GTE and the Audi A3 e-tron as import 
vehicles. Under the e-mobility strategy tailored to this market, both joint ventures will supplement existing and future 
import models with the successive introduction of a total of 15 locally produced plug-in hybrids and electrified models by 
2020. In June 2015, Volkswagen signed a cooperation agreement in the area of e-mobility research with Chinese joint 
venture partner 
SAIC, under which the main production facility in Anting will be extended to locally develop and produce 
plug-in hybrid and electric models. Auto Shanghai 2015 saw the unveiling of the Audi A6 L e-tron and the concept car 
Volkswagen C Coupé 
GTE plug-in hybrid models that will be exclusive to the Chinese market. The Audi A6 L e-tron will be 
manufactured at the Audi plant in Changchun operated by the 
FAW-Volkswagen joint venture and the Volkswagen C Coupé 
GTE by the SAIC VOLKSWAGEN  joint venture in Anting. 
The Volkswagen Group offers more than 150 imported and locally produced models in the Chinese passenger car 
market, representing the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, 
ŠKODA, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, Bugatti and Volks-
wagen Commercial Vehicles brands. In fiscal year 2015, the Volkswagen Group delivered 3.5 (3.7) million vehicles 
(including imports) to customers in China in a highly competitive market. Five models from the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars brand – the Tiguan, Lavida series, Sagitar, Jetta and Santana – were among the ten best-selling cars in China. At Audi, 
the Audi A6 L, Audi A4 L, and Audi Q5 were the best-selling models. At ŠKODA, the Octavia was the top seller. The ŠKODA 
Yeti recorded the highest increase.

Our two joint ventures,

produced a total of 3.4 million vehicles in the reporting period, 
down 3.1% year-on-year. The joint ventures produce a mixture of 
established Group models and those specially modified for Chinese 
customers (e.g. with a lengthened wheelbase), as well as vehicles 
developed exclusively for the Chinese market (such as the Volks-
wagen Lamando, Lavida, New Bora, New Jetta and New Santana). 
Production commenced on the Gran Santana, a model specially 
developed for Chinese customers, and on the successors of the 
ŠKODA Fabia and Superb in the reporting period.

The joint ventures generated a proportionate operating result of

impact of the more competitive market environment was 
compensated by positive exchange rate effects, the optimization of 
material costs and consistent cost discipline.

Volkswagen Financial Services AG continued its internationalization path in fiscal year 2015: in March, Porsche 
Volkswagen Servicios Financieros SpA started operating in Chile, providing vehicle financing and insurance services. The 
wholly owned Group company is a joint venture between Volkswagen Financial Services AG and the Porsche Holding 
Salzburg subsidiary Porsche Bank AG. This market entry in Chile is designed to jointly boost sales.  
In Puerto Rico, 
VW CREDIT, INC.  entered into a partnership with Reliable Financial Services, the largest local auto-
motive financing company. This enables Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi dealers to offer attractive financing to 
customers in Puerto Rico buying new vehicles.  
The acquisition of all of the shares in Guangzhou Zhiwei Car Leasing Co. Ltd. was completed in October 2015. The 
purpose of this acquisition is the further regional expansion of the long-term rental business in the Chinese market. 
The Volkswagen financial services provider’s funding strategy again proved successful in 2015. The core elements are 
diversification of the instruments used and the broadest possible local funding. This particularly includes money market 
and capital market instruments, asset-backed securities (
ABS) transactions and customer deposits. 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG issued two public bonds with a volume of €1.25 billion in April 2015. Volkswagen 
Leasing GmbH placed two bonds with a total volume of €1.5 billion in the summer. Internationally, it was possible to cover 
refinancing requirements through bonds in Mexico, Australia, Scandinavia, South Korea, Brazil, India and Japan.  
ABS issues are used to securitize loan and leasing receivables in various currency areas. Receivables totaling €7.8 bil-
lion were securitized in 12 
ABS transactions worldwide in 2015. In May 2015, Volkswagen Financial Services AG issued the 
VCL 21 transaction with a volume of €1.0 billion from securitized German leasing contracts – the auto  ABS transaction 
with the lowest risk premium in Europe since the 2008 financial crisis. Shortly afterwards in July, Volkswagen Bank GmbH

Volkswagen Financial Services AG continued its internationalization path in fiscal year 2015: in March, Porsche 
Volkswagen Servicios Financieros SpA started operating in Chile, providing vehicle financing and insurance services. The 
wholly-owned Group company is a joint venture between Volkswagen Financial Services AG and the Porsche Holding 
Salzburg subsidiary Porsche Bank AG. This market entry in Chile is designed to jointly boost sales.  
In Puerto Rico, 
VW CREDIT, INC.  entered into a partnership with Reliable Financial Services, the largest local auto-
motive financing company. This enables Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Audi dealers to offer attractive financing to 
customers in Puerto Rico buying new vehicles.  
The acquisition of all of the shares in Guangzhou Zhiwei Car Leasing Co. Ltd. was completed in October 2015. The 
purpose of this acquisition is the further regional expansion of the long-term rental business in the Chinese market. 
The Volkswagen financial services provider’s funding strategy again proved successful in 2015. The core elements are 
diversification of the instruments used and the broadest possible local funding. This particularly includes money market 
and capital market instruments, asset-backed securities (
ABS) transactions and customer deposits. 
Volkswagen Financial Services AG issued two public bonds with a volume of €1.25 billion in April 2015. Volkswagen 
Leasing GmbH placed two bonds with a total volume of €1.5 billion in the summer. Internationally, it was possible to cover 
refinancing requirements through bonds in Mexico, Australia, Scandinavia, South Korea, Brazil, India and Japan.  
ABS issues are used to securitize loan and leasing receivables in various currency areas. Receivables totaling €7.8 bil-
lion were securitized in 12 
ABS transactions worldwide in 2015. In May 2015, Volkswagen Financial Services AG issued the 
VCL 21 transaction with a volume of €1.0 billion from securitized German leasing contracts – the auto  ABS transaction 
with the lowest risk premium in Europe since the 2008 financial crisis. Shortly afterwards in July, Volkswagen Bank GmbH 
established the new Driver Master program, and at the same time issued the second auto ABS transaction in China. At the

80,"IRREGULARITIES IN EMISSIONS
On September 18, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agen-
cy (
EPA) publicly announced in a “Notice of Violation” that irregu-
larities in relation to nitrogen oxide (
NOX) emissions had been dis-
covered in emissions tests on certain vehicles with Volkswagen 
Group diesel engines. It has been alleged that we had used undis-
closed engine management software installed in certain four-cyl-
inder diesel engines used in certain 2009 to 2015 model year vehi-
cles to circumvent 
NOX emissions testing regulations in the United 
States of America in order to comply with certification require-
ments. The US environmental authority of California – the Califor-
nia Air Resources Board (
CARB) – announced its own enforcement 
investigation in this context. Following these announcements by 
EPA and CARB, authorities in various other jurisdictions world-
wide commenced their own investigations. Volkswagen publicly 
admitted

 
to
 
irregularities
 
on
 
September
 
22,
 
2015.
On November 2, 2015, the EPA issued another “Notice of  
Viola
tion” alleging that irregularities had also been discovered in 
the software installed in vehicles with type V6 3.0 l diesel engines. 
CARB also issued a letter announcing its own enforcement investi-
gation

 
in
 
this
 
context. 
In the course of the internal inquiries at Volkswagen, we also 
encountered evidence that irregularities in the determination of 
the CO
2 figures for vehicles’ type approvals in the EU28 countries 
could

 
initially
 
not
 
be
 
ruled
 
out.EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS BY VOLKSWAGEN 
Volkswagen’s reaction has been comprehensive and the Company 
is working intensively to clarify the irregularities. To this end, 
Volkswagen ordered both internal inquiries and external investi-
gations. The external investigation is being conducted with the 
involvement of external lawyers in Germany and the 
USA. To facil-
itate the investigations in the course of clarifying the facts, the 
Group Board of Management established a cooperation program, 
which was in place for a limited time and was open to all employees 
covered

 
by
 
collective
 
agreements. 
The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG formed a special 
committee that coordinates all activities relating to the emissions 
issue for the Supervisory Board. Further information regarding 
the Special Committee on Diesel Engines can be found in the  
Report of the Supervisory Board on pages 12 to 17. Volkswagen AG 
retained the US law firm Jones Day to conduct an independent and 
comprehensive external investigation of the diesel issue. Jones 
Day is updating the Company on the current results of its investi- 
gation

 
on
 
an
 
ongoing
 basis. 
Furthermore, Volkswagen AG filed a criminal complaint in 
September 2015 with the responsible public prosecutor’s office in 
Braunschweig.
We are cooperating with all the responsible authorities to clarify 
these matters completely and transparently. Jones Day is supporting

The Emissions Issue",,,,,,,,,,
81,"DIESEL ISSUE
Four-cylinder diesel engines
In its ad hoc release dated September 22, 2015, the Volkswagen 
Group announced that there were discrepancies in relation to 
NOX 
emissions figures in vehicles with type EA 189 diesel engines. 
Around eleven million vehicles worldwide were affected. This is 
attributable to the engine management software. The vehicles 
remain

 
technically
 safe 
and
 
ready
 
to
 
drive. 
 
Technical solutions have been prepared for the three European 
variants of the type EA 189 engine affected. These solutions have 
been approved in principle by the German Kraftfahrtbundesamt 
(German Federal Motor Transport Authority) for Volkswagen AG 
and 
AUDI AG. The Group brands SEAT and ŠKODA also received 
approvals in principle each from their respective type approval 
authorities – the Ministry of Industry in Spain and the Vehicle 
Certification Agency in the United Kingdom. We are now working 
expeditiously to implement the technical solutions in order to 
en
sure that all legal requirements are met in the EU28 member 
states. The recall of the highest-volume variant – the 2.0 l 
TDI  
engine –already began in January 2016. The recall of the 1.2 l 
TDI 
is expected to commence at the end of the second quarter. A  
software update is being performed for these engine versions. The 
implementation phase for the recall of the 1.6 l 
TDI engine is 
scheduled for the third quarter, which will provide additional lead 
time necessary for the hardware modification. In the 1.6 l 
TDI 
engines, a “flow transformer” will be fitted in front of the air mass 
sensor to improve the sensor’s measuring accuracy. Combined 
with updated software, this will optimize the amount of diesel in-jected. Based on current planning, implementation of measures 
will take at least the full 2016 calendar year to complete. Holders of 
affected vehicles will be notified by Volkswagen when their cars 
can have their software updated and, where appropriate, receive 
the modified hardware. Volkswagen guarantees that the solutions 
will
 
be
 
implemented
 
free
 
of
 charge. 
In addition, Volkswagen AG has, until December 31, 2017, 
expressly waived citation of the statute of limitations with regard to 
any claims made in relation to the software installed in vehicles 
with engines of type EA 189 by vehicle customers outside the United 
States
 
and
 
Canada.
In some countries outside the EU – among others Switzerland, 
Australia and Turkey – national type approval is based on prior 
recognition of the 
EC/ECE type approval. We are also working 
closely with the authorities in these countries to coordinate the 
corresponding

 
actions.
In North America, three variants of certain four-cylinder die-
sel engines are affected. Due to considerably stricter 
NOX limits in 
the 
USA, it is a greater technical challenge to refit the vehicles so 
that all applicable emissions limits can be met. Volkswagen is cur-
rently in intensive discussions with the 
EPA and CARB concerning 
remedial measures. We will present the solution for North America 
as soon as it has been agreed with the responsible authorities.

Clarification regarding four-cylinder diesel engines advancing
Some 450 internal and external experts are involved in the work to 
clarify the issue, which is divided into two investigations. The 
Group Internal Audit function, which involved bringing together 
experts from various Group companies to form a task force, and 
focused – as instructed by the Supervisory Board and Board of 
Management – on reviewing relevant processes, reporting and 
control systems as well as the accompanying infrastructure. The 
Group Internal Audit function provided its findings to the external 
experts from Jones Day. The internationally renowned law firm 
has been appointed by Volkswagen AG to fully clarify the facts and 
responsibilities in a second investigation. Jones Day is receiving 
operational

 
support
 
from
 
the
 
auditing
 
firm
 
Deloitte.
The special investigation involves conducting briefings with 
employees and managers who have been identified by Jones Day as 
relevant sources of information in connection with the diesel issue. 
In addition, Jones Day is evaluating documents and data (such  
as e-mails) and conducting follow-up interviews based on the doc-
uments that are relevant for clarifying the facts. Relationships 
between the various areas under investigation will also be analyzed

 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT
  


The Emissions Issue",,,,,,,,,,
82,"Based on the facts currently known by the Group Internal  
Audit function, in the past there were process deficiencies on the 
technical side in addition to misconduct on the part of individuals. 
This was true of the testing and certification processes for the  
engine control units, for example, which were unsuited to pre-
venting the use of the software in question. The Group Internal 
Audit function proposed specific remedial measures to address 
the identified weaknesses, which focus on creating more clearly 
structured and systematic processes on the technical side. For  
example, the processes and structures used for approving the  
software for engine control units are being reorganized with more 
clearly defined and

 
binding
 
powers
 
and
 
responsibilities. 
We have already resolved to make comprehensive changes to 
testing practices on the technical side as a key response to the 
Group Internal Audit function’s findings. Therefore, Volkswagen 
has decided that in the future emissions tests, in general, will be 
externally evaluated by independent third parties. Real-world ran-
dom tests of vehicles’ emissions behavior on the road will also be 
introduced. 
Furthermore, the internal control system has been optimized 
through a new set of regulations for the procedure in control unit 
software development, emission classification and escalation 
management.
While the Group Internal Audit function has already com- 
pleted its analysis of the Company’s processes, the work being 
done by Jones Day will continue well into 2016. One reason for the 
different durations of the investigations is that the external inves-
tigators must screen very large volumes of data. By the end of  
December, over 100 terabytes of data had been secured and more 
than 1,500 electronic data storage devices from some 380 employees 
had been collected. Moreover, the external investigation is seek-
ing to establish legal responsibility for what has occurred. This 
means that the findings not only need to be plausible and consist-
ent

 
with
 
the
 
evidence,
 
but
 
must
 
also
 
stand
 
up
 
in
 
court. 
Employees from the affected departments have been dis-
missed as a further direct consequence of the findings to date 
from

 
the
 
internal
 
inquiries
 
and
 
external
 
investigations.
The information that has been viewed so far has helped trace 
the origin and development of the diesel issue to a large extent. The 
starting point was the strategic decision to launch a large-scale 
promotion of diesel vehicles in the 
USA in 2005. To this end, a new 
diesel powertrain unit featuring high performance and cost-effi-
cient production – the EA 189 type engine – was to be developed.
The US emissions limits for emissions of pollutants are strict.  
Under the strictest standard in the 
USA at the time, only 31 mg/km 
of 
NOX were allowed to be emitted, about six times less than under 
the Euro 5 standard applicable in Europe at that time. When  designing state-of-the-art diesel engines, technicians and engi-
neers face the challenge that measures to reduce NOX categorically 
have a knock-on
 
effect
 
on
 
other
 
parameters
  
(e.g.
 
CO2).
In the ensuing period, in order to resolve this conflicting  
objective satisfactorily within the time frame and budget of the  
EA 189 project, according to the current state of knowledge, a 
group of persons – whose identity is still being determined – at 
levels below the Group’s Board of Management in the powertrain  
development division, decided to modify the engine management 
software. With this software modification, emissions values were 
generated in bench testing that differed substantially from those 
under

 
real
 
driving
 
conditions.
As things stand, outside the group of persons mentioned above, 
the then and current Board of Management of Volkswagen AG 
had, at any rate, no knowledge of the use of unlawful engine man-
agement software at the time. Even after the International Council 
on Clean Transportation (
ICCT) study was published in May 2014, 
the discrepancies were initially regarded – on the basis of the facts 
currently known regarding the members of the Board of Manage-
ment responsible at that time – as a technical problem that did not 
basically differ from other everyday technical problems at an  
automotive company. In the exhaust measurements carried out  
inhouse at Volkswagen in the subsequent months, the test set-ups 
on which the 
ICCT study was based were repeated and the unusu-
ally high 
NOX emissions confirmed. CARB was informed of this 
result, and at the same time the offer was made to recalibrate the 
type EA 189 diesel engines as part of a service measure that was 
already planned in the 
USA. This measure was evaluated and 
adopted by the Ausschuss für Produktsicherheit (
APS – product 
safety committee), which includes, among others, employees 
from the technical development, quality assurance, sales,  
production, logistics, procurement and legal departments, as 
part of the existing processes within the Volkswagen Group. The 
APS thus plays a central role in the internal control system at  
Volkswagen AG. There are currently no reliable findings to con-
firm that an unlawful software modification was reported by the 
APS as the cause of the discrepancies to the persons responsible 
for preparing the 2014 annual and consolidated financial state-
ments. Instead, at the time that the annual and consolidated  
financial statements were being prepared, this group of people 
remained under the impression that the discrepancies could be 
eliminated with comparatively little effort as a part of a field 
measure. Based on what is currently known, the actual back-
ground of the discrepancies only became clear gradually to the 
members of the Board of Management dealing with the matter. It 
was only reliably recognized in the summer of 2015 that the 
cause of the discrepancies was a software modification, to be

The Emissions Issue",,,,,,,,,,
83,"qualified as a so-called “defeat device” as defined by US environ-
mental law. This culminated in the disclosure of the “defeat  
device” to the 
EPA/CARB on September 3, 2015. According to the 
assessment at that time of the members of the Board of Manage-
ment dealing with the matter, the scope of the costs expected as 
a result by the Volkswagen Group (recall costs, retrofitting costs 
and financial penalties), was basically not dissimilar to that of 
previous cases in which other vehicle manufacturers were  
involved, and therefore appeared to be controllable overall with 
a view to the business activities of the Volkswagen Group. This 
appraisal by Volkswagen AG was based on the assessment of a law 
firm brought in in the 
USA for approval issues, according to which 
similar cases in the past were resolved amicably with the US  
authorities. Publication of a “Notice of Violation” by the 
EPA on 
September 18, 2015, which came as a surprise to the company, 
on the facts and possible financial consequences, then
 presented 
the
 
situation
 
in
 a 
completely
 
different
 
light.
Six-cylinder diesel engines
On November 2, 2015, the EPA announced that it had determined 
that engine management software installed in vehicles with V6 3.0 l 
TDI diesel engines contains “auxiliary emission control devices” 
(
AECDs) which had not been disclosed adequately in the US type 
approval process. Also on November 2, and additionally on  
November 25, 2015, the 
CARB published allegations that legal  
requirements for 
NOX emissions were circumvented through the 
use

 
of
 
engine
 
management
 
software
 
under
 
test
 
conditions. tive US companies of the Volkswagen Group have withdrawn

Clarification regarding six-cylinder diesel engines
Audi has confirmed that a total of three AECDs were not declared 
in

 
the
 
course
 
of
 
the
 
US
 
approval
 
documentation.  
To clarify this issue, Audi set up an internal task force, fur-
nished committees with the necessary resources and launched a 
program of cooperation for employees covered by collective agree-
ments. The law firm Jones Day is also conducting independent and 
comprehensive

 
investigations
  
into
 
this
 
matter. 
The incumbent members of the Board of Management of 
AUDI 
AG
 have declared that prior to the notification by the US Environ-
mental Protection Agency 
EPA in November 2015 they had no 
knowledge of matters concerning the V6 
TDI 3.0 l engines that the 
authorities

 
are
 
now
 
treating
  
as
 
infringements.
We are consistently seeking to realize organizational and pro-
cedural potential for improvement that has come to light as a result 
of

 
the
 
diesel
 issue.
On January 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (
DOJ), on  
behalf of the 
EPA, filed a civil complaint against Volkswagen AG, 
AUDI AG and other companies of the Volkswagen Group. The 
claims asserted under civil law are founded on the alleged use of 
illegal (defeat device) software in violation of the American Clean 
Air Act. The complaint’s allegations relate to both the four- 
cylinder and the six-cylinder diesel engines, although technically 
Volkswagen AG Group-wide held internal development responsi-
bility for the four-cylinder diesel engines within the Group, and 
AUDI
 AG 
for
 
the
 
V6
 
3.0

engines.   
CO2 issue
In the course of the internal inquiries at Volkswagen of all diesel 
engines, we additionally found that initially we could not rule out 
irregularities in determining the CO
2 figures for vehicle type  
approval in the EU28 member states. The CO
2 levels, and thus also 
the fuel consumption figures, appeared to have been set too low in 
the case of some vehicle models during the CO
2 certification pro-
cess. On November 3, 2015, we informed the public that around 
800,000 vehicles, primarily with diesel engines, could be affected. 
Our

 
initial
 
estimate
 
put
 
the
 
economic
 
risk
 
at
 
€2
 
billion. 
Clarification of the CO2 issue
The investigations conducted into the potentially illegal manipu- 
lation of CO

84,"2015, we were able to publicly announce that clarification of the 
CO
2 issue had largely been completed. Following extensive inter-
nal reviews and measurement checks, we found slight discrepan-
cies in only a very limited number of engine-transmission variants 
from the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand. These variants are 
now being reviewed by a neutral technical service under the super-
vision of the authorities. The discrepancies between the stated  
figures and the values found during testing, on average, amount to 
a few grams of CO
2. No technical modifications to the vehicles are 
required and real-world consumption figures for customers are 
unchanged. The catalog figures will be adjusted for the affected 
variants

 
in

IMPACT ON THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP
Operating result for 2015
As a result of the irregularities in the software used in certain diesel 
engines, provisions totaling €16.2 billion were recognized and 
charged to operating result, primarily for pending technical mod-
ifications, for repurchases, and customer-related measures as 
well

 
as
 
legal
 risks.   
The special items originally expected as a result of the CO

issue
 
have
 
not
 
materialized. 
We have therefore adjusted the Group’s earnings targets ac-
cordingly, and have revised investment planning and intensified

program.
Legal risks
Various legal risks are associated with the diesel issue. The provi-
sions recognized for this matter in the amount of €7.0 billion are 
partially subject to substantial estimation risks given the complex-
ity of the individual factors, the ongoing approval process with the 
authorities and the fact that the comprehensive, exhaustive inves-
tigations have not yet been completed. The legal risks include

173.Ratings and rankings
As a result of the emissions issue, Moody’s Investors Service 
downgraded Volkswagen AG’s short- and long-term ratings by one 
notch each from P–1 to P–2 and A2 to A3 in November 2015. The 
long-term ratings for Volkswagen Financial Services AG and 
Volkswagen Bank GmbH were downgraded from Aa3 to A1. The 
rating agency lowered the outlook for the companies from stable 
to

 
negative.  
In connection with the irregularities in the software used for 
certain diesel engines from the Volkswagen Group, in October 
2015 Standard & Poor’s initially downgraded the short-term and 
long-term ratings for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Financial  
Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH by one notch each, to 
A–2

 
and
 
A–
 
respectively. 
In a further step in December 2015, also as a result of the emis-
sions issue, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the long-term ratings 
for Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Financial Services AG from A– 
to 
BBB+. The outlook for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Financial 
Services

is
 
negative. 
Share price development
The emergence of the news about irregularities in the software 
used in certain diesel engines and the resulting public speculation 
about possible consequences to be expected led to a sharp fall in 
the prices of Volkswagen AG’s ordinary and preferred shares in 
mid-September 2015. After reaching the lowest closing price for 
the year at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Volkswagen shares 
recovered temporarily from their sharp declines. As a result of the 
news that, as part of the internal inquiries at Volkswagen of all  
diesel engines, we also encountered evidence that irregularities 
in the determination of the CO
2 figures for vehicles’ type approvals 
in the EU28 countries could initially not be ruled out, the prices of 
both classes of shares trended lower again. As the fourth quarter 
progressed, the provision of technical solutions for our customers 
in the EU28 countries to rectify the irregularities in 
NOX emissions 
and the clarification of the CO
2 issue led to a rise in the share price 
amid

 
significant
 
fluctuations.

up a newly created responsibility as member of the Board of  
Management of Volkswagen AG for Integrity and Legal Affairs. 
This is a clear indication of the great importance we attach to 
these

 issues. 
REALIGNMENT OF THE GROUP
In late October 2015, the Group Board of Management announced 
a five-point plan to realign the Group. The first and most impor-
tant priority is to provide technical solutions for our customers and 
therefore to work closely with the authorities. The second priority 
is to pursue and complete the investigation independently and sys-
tematically. This will involve examining the facts and analyzing 
how they occurred, with the aim of ensuring that such mistakes 
cannot occur again. The third priority is to implement the new 
Group structure. The Volkswagen Group’s management will be 
more decentralized in future, with greater independence for 
brands and regions. This will mean better sharing of responsibility 
and will encourage entrepreneurial thinking and behavior. Our 
decisions and processes will become leaner, faster and more effi-
cient. The Group Board of Management will focus on its core role: 
pursuing major Groupwide topics for the future and working on 
synergies, control and strategy. The fourth point involves a re- 
alignment of culture and management practices at Volkswagen. Establishing a new way of thinking takes time. We want our work 
to be defined by open and honest communication, a constructive 
approach to dealing with mistakes and greater courage and inno-
vation. The fifth and final point is the Group’s new objectives. In 
2008 the Volkswagen Group sent a strong signal with its Strategy 
2018. The cornerstones remain unchanged: satisfied customers, 
motivated employees, excellent quality products and services, sus-
tainable profitability and ecological responsibility. Additionally, 
the “Future Tracks” initiative (see also page 132) has already laid 
the valuable groundwork for the realignment, enabling us to  
address the issues of the future such as e-mobility, the digital shift 
and new business models. We are developing our Strategy 2025 for the Volkswagen Group on this basis, with which we will  
deter
mine our technological and strategic direction for the next 
ten

 years. 
TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS
Volkswagen does not tolerate any infringements of rules or laws. 
The irregularities that occurred contradict everything Volkswagen 
stands for. The trust of our customers and the public is, and will 
remain, our most important asset. We are sincerely sorry that we 
have disappointed our stakeholders. We will do everything within 
our power to prevent incidents of these kinds from reoccurring

Goals and Strategies  
 
55  
The Volkswagen Group sent a strong signal with the launch of its 
Strategy 2018 in 2008. The clear and ambitious goals triggered 
significant momentum within the Company, laying the foundation 
for the Group’s significant success in recent years. In this context, 
and in light of the fundamental changes both in the automotive 
industry and within the Company itself, now is the time to realign 
the Volkswagen Group, both technologically and strategically. The 
basis for this realignment is our Strategy 2018, in which we defined 
four goals that are intended to make Volkswagen the most 
successful, fascinating and sustainable automaker in the world: 
> Volkswagen intends to deploy intelligent innovations and tech-
nologies to become a world leader in customer satisfaction and 
quality. We see high customer satisfaction as one of the key 
requirements for the Company’s long-term success. 
> The goal is to generate unit sales of more than 10 million vehicles 
a year; in particular, Volkswagen intends to capture an above-
average share of growth in the major growth markets.  
> Volkswagen’s aim is a long-term return on sales before tax of at 
least 8% so as to ensure that the Group’s solid financial position 
is guaranteed and that it retains the ability to act even in difficult 
market periods.  
> Volkswagen aims to be the most attractive employer in the auto-
motive industry. The aim is to have the best team in the sector: 
highly qualified, fit and above all motivated. 
Our particular focus is on the environmentally friendly orientation 
and profitability of our vehicle projects so that the Volkswagen 
Group can achieve success even in more challenging conditions. 
We are selectively expanding our range of vehicles to safeguard the 
strong position enjoyed by our individual brands and to system-
atically increase our competitive advantages. 
Our activities are primarily designed to set new standards in the 
areas of vehicles, drivetrains and lightweight construction. Our 
modular toolkit system, which we are enhancing on an ongoing basis, allows us to improve the Group’s production efficiency and 
flexibility, and thus also its profitability.  
In addition, we intend to continually expand our customer base 
by increasing satisfaction among our existing customers and 
acquiring new customers around the world, particularly in the 
growth markets. In order to ensure this, we are increasingly 
adapting our products and services to the specific local require-
ments. We shall continue the measures we are currently taking to 
improve our productivity and quality regardless of the economic 
situation and without any time limit. These include our regional 
development teams and our cooperation with local suppliers, 
among other things. We are also continuing to standardize pro-
cesses in both the direct and indirect areas and are reducing 
production throughput times. Together with disciplined cost and 
investment management, these measures play a major role in 
ensuring that we reach our long-term profitability targets and 
safeguard solid long-term liquidity.  
We will only successfully meet the challenges of today and 
tomorrow if all employees – from vocational trainees through to the 
Board of Management – consistently deliver excellence. Outstand-
ing performance, the success that comes from it and participation 
in its rewards are therefore at the heart of our human resources 
strategy.  
Satisfied customers and motivated employees, excellent quality 
products and services, sustainable profitability and ecological 
responsibility are the cornerstones of the Strategy 2018, and 
remain unchanged. Additionally, the “Future Tracks” initiative has 
already laid the valuable groundwork for the realignment, enabling 
us to address the issues of the future such as e-mobility, the digital 
shift and new business models. We are developing our Strategy 
2025 for the Volkswagen Group on this basis, and aim to present the 
results starting in mid-2016. The initial phase focuses on three 
issues: digitalization, integrity and legal affairs, and sustainability. 

 
 
Goals  and Strategies  

The Volkswagen Group aims to increase its unit sales and profitability for the long term. This is why 
its Strategy 2018 – with which Volkswagen intends to become the most successful, fascinating and 
sustainable automobile manufacturer – has been anchored in the Company. We are realigning our 
target system due to the fundamental changes in the automotive industry and within the 
Volkswagen Group.",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Internal Management System and Key Performance Indicators  
56  The Volkswagen Group’s performance and success can be measured 
using both financial and nonfinancial key performance indicators. 
The following starts by describing the internal management 
process, and then explains the Volkswagen Group’s core perfor-
mance indicators.  
 
INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
The starting point for the Volkswagen Group’s internal manage-
ment is the medium-term planning conducted once a year. This 
generally covers a period of five years and forms the core of our 
operational planning. It is used to formulate and check the require-
ments for realizing strategic projects designed to meet Group 
targets in both technical and economic terms – and particularly in 
relation to earnings and liquidity effects. In addition, it is used to 
coordinate all business areas with respect to the strategic action 
areas concerned: functions/processes, products and markets.  
When planning the Company’s future, the individual planning 
components are determined on the basis of the timescale involved: 
> The long-term unit sales plan, which sets out market and 
segment growth and then derives the Volkswagen Group’s 
delivery volumes from them. 
> The product program as the strategic, long-term factor deter-
mining corporate policy. 
> Capacity and utilization planning for the individual locations. 
 The coordinated results of the upstream planning processes are 
used as the basis for the medium-term financial planning: the 
Group’s financial planning, including the brands and business 
fields, comprises the income statement, cash flow and balance 
sheet planning, profitability and liquidity, as well as the upfront 
investments needed for alternative products and the imple-
mentation of strategic options. 
The first year of the medium-term planning period is then fixed 
and a budget drawn up for the individual months. This is planned in 
detail down to the level of the operating cost centers. 
During the year, the budget is reviewed each month to establish 
the degree to which the targets have been met. In the process, 
target/actual comparisons, prior-year comparisons, variance analy-
ses and, if necessary, action plans to ensure targets are met, are key 
instruments within the management system. For the current fiscal 
year, detailed revolving monthly forecasts are prepared for the 
coming three months and the full year. These forecasts take into 
account the current risks and opportunities. The focus of intrayear 
internal management is therefore on adapting ongoing operations. 
At the same time, the current forecast serves as a potential, ongoing 
corrective to the medium-term and budget planning that follows on 
from it.

nternal  Management  System  

and Key Performance 
Indicators 
Based on the goals set out in our Strategy 2018, this chapter describes how the Volkswagen Group 
is managed and the key performance indicators used for this. Alongside financial measures, our 
management system also contains nonfinancial key performance indicators. ",,,,,,,,,,

Internal Management System and Key Performance Indicators  
 
57  CORE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
The Volkswagen Group’s internal management is based on seven 
core performance indicators, which are derived from the goals set 
out in our Strategy 2018:  
> Deliveries to customers 
> Sales revenue 
> Operating result 
> Operating return on sales 
> Capex/sales revenue in the Automotive Division 
> Net cash flow in the Automotive Division 
> Return on investment ( ROI) in the Automotive Division 
Deliveries to customers are defined as handovers of new vehicles to 
the end customer. This figure shows the popularity of our products 
with customers and is the measure we use to determine our 
competitive position in our markets. Increasing deliveries to 
customers is closely linked to our objectives of offering superior 
customer satisfaction and quality, as well as achieving unit sales of 
more than 10 million vehicles – including the Chinese joint 
ventures. High customer satisfaction, combined with and based on 
the outstanding quality of our vehicles, is one of the most important 
preconditions for the Company’s long-term success. Demand for 
our products is what drives our unit sales and production, and 
hence determines capacity utilization at our locations. Only 
employees who are highly qualified, fit and above all motivated can 
meet the goals we have set ourselves and ensure long-term financial 
success. 
Sales revenue, which does not include the figures for our 
equity-accounted Chinese joint ventures, reflects our market 
success in financial terms. Following adjustment for our use of 
resources, the operating result reflects the Company’s actual 
business activity and documents economic output in our core 
business. The operating return on sales is the ratio of the operating 
result to sales revenue. The ratio of capex (investments in property, plant and equipment, 
investment property and intangible assets, excluding capitalized 
development costs) to sales revenue in the Automotive Division 
reflects both our innovative power and our competitiveness. It 
compares our capital expenditure – largely for modernizing and 
expanding our product range and environmentally friendly drive-
trains, as well as for increasing capacity and improving production 
processes – to the Automotive Division’s sales revenue. 
Net cash flow in the Automotive Division represents the excess 
funds from operating activities available for dividend payments, for 
example. It is calculated as cash flows from operating activities less 
cash flows from investing activities attributable to operating 
activities. 
We use the return on investment (
ROI) to calculate the return on 
invested capital for a particular period in the Automotive Division, 
including the Chinese joint ventures on a proportionate basis, by 
calculating the ratio of the operating result after tax to invested 
capital. If the return on investment (
ROI) exceeds the market cost of 
capital, the value of the Company has increased. This is how we 
measure the success of our brands, locations and vehicle projects. 
You can find information and explanations on the sales figures 
and the Volkswagen Group’s financial key performance indicators 
on pages 94 to 99 and on pages 109 to 125, respectively. 
Detailed descriptions of our activities and additional non-
financial key performance indicators in the areas of corporate 
social responsibility, research and development, procurement, 
production, sales and marketing, quality assurance, employees, 
information technology and environmental management can be 
found in the chapter entitled “Sustainable Value Enhancement”

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Structure and Business Activities  
58  OUTLINE OF THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP Volkswagen AG is the parent company of the Volkswagen Group. It 
develops vehicles and components for the Group’s brands, but also 
produces and sells vehicles, in particular passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles for the Volkswagen Passenger Cars and 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands. In its function as parent 
company, Volkswagen AG holds indirect or direct interests in 
AUDI AG, SEAT S.A., ŠKODA AUTO  a.s., Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, 
Scania AB, 
MAN SE, Volkswagen Financial Services AG and a  
large number of other companies in Germany and abroad. More 
detailed disclosures are contained in the list of shareholdings in 
accordance with sections 285 and 313 of the Handelsgesetzbuch 
(
HGB – German Commercial Code), which can be accessed at 
www.volkswagenag.com/ir and is part of the annual financial 
statements. 
Volkswagen AG is a vertically integrated energy company within 
the meaning of section 3 No. 38 of the Energiewirtschaftsgesetz 
(EnWG – German Energy Industry Act) and is therefore subject to 
the provisions of the EnWG. In the electricity sector, Volkswagen AG 
performs electricity generation, sales and distribution together 
with a Group subsidiary.  
Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management is the ultimate body 
responsible for managing the Group. The Supervisory Board 
appoints, monitors and advises the Board of Management; it is 
consulted directly on decisions that are of fundamental significance 
for the Company. 
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP 
The Volkswagen Group is one of the leading multibrand groups in 
the automotive industry. The Company’s business activities 
comprise the Automotive and Financial Services divisions. All 
brands in the Automotive Division – with the exception of the 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles 
brands – are legally independent separate companies. The business 
activities of the various companies in the Volkswagen Group focus 
on developing, producing and selling passenger cars, light com-
mercial vehicles, trucks and buses. The product portfolio ranges 
  from motorcycles to fuel-efficient small cars and luxury vehicles. In 
the commercial vehicles segment, the  MAN and Scania commercial 
vehicles brands were bundled under Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH 
in fiscal year 2015. Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH manages and 
coordinates the cooperation. Here, too, the brands continue to 
retain their independence. The commercial vehicles segment’s 
offering begins with small pickups and extends to heavy trucks and 
buses. Power Engineering manufactures large-bore diesel engines 
and special gear units, among other things. A broad range of 
financial services rounds off the offering. With its brands, the 
Volkswagen Group has a presence in all relevant markets around 
the world. Western Europe, China, the 
USA, Brazil and Mexico are 
currently the key sales markets for the Group. 
Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group are managed by 
Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management in accordance with the 
Volkswagen AG Articles of Association and the rules of procedure 
for Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management issued by the Super-
visory Board. 
 Volkswagen’s strategic management is largely conducted at 
Group level by various committees. These committees, which are 
composed of representatives both of the relevant central depart-
ments and the corresponding functions in the Company’s business 
areas, cover the following basic functions, among other things: 
product planning, investment, liquidity and foreign currency, and 
management issues.  
Each brand in the Volkswagen Group is managed by a board of 
management, which ensures its independent development and its 
business operations. The Group targets and requirements laid 
down by the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG must be 
complied with to the extent permitted by law. This allows Group-
wide interests to be pursued while at the same time safeguarding 
and reinforcing each brand’s specific characteristics. Matters that 
are of importance to the Group as a whole are submitted to the 
Group Board of Management in order – to the extent permitted by 
law – to reach agreement between the parties involved. The rights 
and obligations of the statutory bodies of the relevant brand 
companies remain unaffected.

Structure and Business Activities  
 
59 The companies of the Volkswagen Group are managed separately by 
their respective managements. In addition to the interests of their 
own companies, each individual company management takes into 
account the interests of the Group and of the individual brands in 
accordance with the framework laid down by law.  
Following the announcement of the realignment of Group 
structures, we have been fine-tuning the management model since 
September 2015 and adjusting its specific structure. This involves 
defining the functional, divisional and regional responsibilities in 
greater detail and strengthening corporate responsibility within the 
brands and regions. The clear strategic focus of the Group functions 
aims to increase the Group’s decision-making speed and agility. It 
will allow the Group Board of Management to concentrate to a 
greater extent on its core tasks, which include strategy and 
managing major synergy levers such as modular toolkits, key 
technologies and procurement, as well as plant capacity utilization. 
The cross-brand modular toolkit and product strategy is another 
core task. 
Further information on the Volkswagen Group’s future 
organizational alignment can be found in the Report on Expected 
Developments on page 168. 
MATERIAL CHANGES IN EQUITY INVESTMENTS 
The control and profit and loss transfer agreement between 
MAN SE, as the controlled company, and Volkswagen Truck & 
Bus GmbH (formerly Truck & Bus GmbH), a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary of Volkswagen AG, as the controlling company, came into 
force on its entry in the commercial register on July 16, 2013. The 
conclusion of the control and profit and loss transfer agreement 
replaced the group based on the de facto exercise of management 
control by a “contractual group”, permitting considerably more 
efficient and less bureaucratic cooperation between the 
MAN 
Group and the rest of the Volkswagen Group. Noncontrolling 
interest shareholders of 
MAN SE have the right to tender  MAN 
ordinary and preferred shares in Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH 
during and two months after the conclusion of the award pro-
ceedings instituted in July 2013 to review the appropriateness of the 
cash settlement set out in the agreement in accordance with section 
305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) and 
the cash compensation in accordance with section 304 of the AktG. 
The Munich Regional Court ruled in the first instance at the end of 
July 2015 that the settlement payable to the shareholders should be 
increased from €80.89 to €90.29 per share. Both Volkswagen and a 
number of the noncontrolling interest shareholders have appealed 
to the Higher Regional Court in Munich. At the end of December 
2015, Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH held 75.56% of the ordinary 
shares and 46.19% of the preferred shares of 
MAN SE. 
On March 14, 2014, Volkswagen AG made a voluntary tender 
offer to Scania’s shareholders for all shares not previously held by  
Volkswagen either directly or indirectly. Following completion of the 
offer, Volkswagen increased its interest in Scania’s share capital to 
99.57% at the end of 2014. A squeeze-out was initiated for the 
Scania shares not tendered in the course of the offer, and on 
 November 11, 2014 the court of arbitration ruled in the squeeze-
out proceedings that all Scania shares outstanding would be 
transferred to Volkswagen AG. Volkswagen AG has been the indirect 
and direct legal owner of all Scania shares since January 14, 2015, 
when the decision became final and unappealable. The arbitration 
proceedings to determine an appropriate settlement are continuing. 
On August 29, 2015, the arbitration ruling was delivered to the 
parties in the proceedings relating to the cooperation agreement 
between Volkswagen AG and the Suzuki Motor Corporation. It 
found that Volkswagen had acted in accordance with the agreement. 
The arbitration court also confirmed that Suzuki was in breach of 
contract and, on the merits of this case, acknowledged that Volks-
wagen had a claim to damages. In addition, the arbitration court 
established that the parties had the right to give regular notice to 
terminate the cooperation agreement. It said that Suzuki had 
exercised this right, ending the partnership. According to the court, 
the agreements had to be interpreted in such a way that Volkswagen 
had to sell its equity investment in Suzuki on termination of the 
partnership. Volkswagen consequently sold its 19.9% equity 
investment in Suzuki to Suzuki on September 17, 2015 at the 
quoted market price of €3.1 billion. In February 2016, Volkswagen 
and Suzuki agreed a settlement regarding the claims for damages 
brought by Volkswagen.  LEGAL FACTORS INFLUENCING BUSINESS 
Volkswagen companies are affected – as are other international 
companies – by numerous laws in Germany and abroad. In partic-
ular, there are legal requirements relating to development, pro-
duction and distribution, as well as to tax, company, commercial, 
financial and capital market regulations, and those relating to labor, 
banking, state aid, energy, environmental and insurance law.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Corporate Governance Report  
60  A BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESSFUL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE: THE 
GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE Corporate governance establishes a framework for managing and 
supervising a company. This includes its organization and values, 
and the principles and guidelines for its business policy, among 
other things. The German Corporate Governance Code contains 
recommendations and suggestions for good and responsible cor-
porate management and supervision. It was prepared by the govern-
ment commission established for the purpose on the basis of the 
material provisions and nationally and internationally accepted 
standards of corporate governance. As a rule, the government com-
mission reviews the Code annually in light of current developments 
and updates it as necessary. The Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG base their work on the recom-
mendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance 
Code. We believe that good corporate governance is a key condition 
for sustainably increasing the Company’s value. It helps strengthen 
the trust of our shareholders, customers, employees, business 
partners and investors in our work and meet the steadily increasing 
demand for information from national and international stake-
holders. 
 
DECLARATIONS OF CONFORMITY (VALID AS OF THE DATE OF THE 
RELEVANT DECLARATION) 
The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Volks-
wagen AG issued the annual declaration of conformity with the 
German Corporate Governance Code as required by section 161 of 
the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) on Novem-
ber 20, 2015 with the following wording: 
“The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board declare that: 
1) The recommendations of the Government Commission of the 
German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated 
June 24, 2014 (the “Code”) published by the German Ministry of 
Justice in the official section of the Federal Gazette (Bundes-
anzeiger) on September 30, 2014 were complied with in the period 
from the last Declaration of Conformity dated November 21, 2014 until the entry into force on June 12, 2015 of the amended version 
of the Code dated May 5, 2015 with the exception of the numbers 
listed below for the reasons outlined therein.  > a) 4.2.3 paragraph 4 (severance pay cap) 
A severance pay cap will be included in new contracts concluded 
with members of the Board of Management, but not in contracts 
concluded with Board of Management members entering their 
third term of office or beyond, provided a cap did not form part of 
the initial contract. Grandfather rights have been applied 
accordingly. 
> b) 5.1.2 paragraph 2 sentence 3 (age limit for members of the 
Board of Management) 
An age limit for members of the Board of Management is not 
considered to be appropriate because the ability to manage a 
company successfully does not necessarily cease when a specific 
age is reached. A rigid retirement age could also be deemed 
discriminatory. It may be in the interests of the company to 
appoint someone over the age of 65. A rigid retirement age would 
therefore appear to be inappropriate. 
> c) 5.3.2 sentence 3 (independence of the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee) 
It is unclear from the wording of the German Corporate 
Governance Code whether the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
is “independent” within the meaning of number 5.3.2 sentence 3 
of the Code. Such independence could be considered lacking in 
view of his membership of the Supervisory Board of Porsche 
Automobil Holding SE, kinship with other members of the 
Supervisory Board of the company and of Porsche Automobil 
Holding SE, his indirect minority interest in Porsche Automobil 
Holding SE, and business relations with other members of the 
Porsche and Piëch families who also have an indirect interest in 
Porsche Automobil Holding SE. However, in the opinion of the 
Supervisory Board and the Board of Management, these 
relationships do not constitute a conflict of interest nor do they 
interfere with his duties as the Chairman of the Audit Committee.   Corporate  Governance  

Report  
Corporate governance stands for responsible, transparent corporate management and supervision 
that aims to add by long-term value. Good corporate governance is not only the basis for lasting 
corporate success but also a key condition for strengthening the trust of our shareholders, customers, 
employees and business partners, as well as the financial markets.  ",,,,,,,,,,

Corporate Governance Report  
 
61 This exception is therefore being declared purely as a precau-
tionary measure. 
> d) 5.4.1 paragraphs 4 to 6 (disclosure regarding election recom-
mendations) 
With regard to recommendation number 5.4.1 paragraphs 4 to 6 
of the Code stating that certain circumstances must be disclosed 
by the Supervisory Board when making election recommen-
dations to the Annual General Meeting, the stipulations of the 
Code are vague and the definitions unclear. Purely as a precau-
tionary measure, the Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board therefore declare a deviation from the Code in this respect. 
Notwithstanding this, the Supervisory Board will make every effort 
to satisfy the requirements of number 5.4.1 paragraphs 4 to 6. 
> e) 5.4.6 paragraph 2 sentence 2 (performance-related compen-
sation of members of the Supervisory Board) 
The remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board is regu-
lated by the shareholders in article 17(1) of the Volkswagen Articles 
of Association. This regulation includes the linking of remuner-
ation to dividend distribution. We therefore assume that we have 
complied with the Code and that the variable compensation 
component is oriented toward the sustainable growth of the 
enterprise as defined in number 5.4.6 paragraph 2 sentence 2 of 
the Code. However, as it cannot be ruled out that other views will 
be taken in this respect, a deviation from this recommendation in 
the Code is being declared as a precautionary measure. 
2) The recommendations of the Government Commission of the 
German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated 
May 5, 2015 (2015 version of the Code) that was published by the 
German Ministry of Justice in the official section of the Federal 
Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on June 12, 2015 were complied with in 
the period from the entry into force of this version on June 12, 2015 
and will continue to be complied with, with the exception of the 
recommendations listed below. 
> a)  4.2.3 paragraph 4 (severance payment cap) 
> b) 5.1.2 paragraph 2 sentence 3 (age limit for members of the 
Board of Management) 
> c) 5.3.2 sentence 3 (independence of the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee) 
> d) 5.4.1 paragraphs 5 to 7 (disclosure regarding election recom-
mendations, formerly 5.4.1 paragraphs 4 to 6) 
> e) 5.4.6 paragraph 2 sentence 2 (performance-related remuner-
ation of members of the Supervisory Board) 
The reasons for the exceptions to a) to e) listed above are explained 
in section 1) above. 
> f) 5.4.1 paragraph 2 sentence 1 (objectives for the composition of 
the Supervisory Board) 
With the entry into force of the 2015 version of the Code, this 
recommendation regarding the objectives for the composition of 
the Supervisory Board was expanded to the effect that the objec-
tives for the composition of the Supervisory Board include the 
specification of a general limit to the length of time that members 
may serve on the Supervisory Board. During the period from the 
entry into force of the amended version of the recommendation 
on June 12, 2015 to the present, the expanded version of this recommendation was not complied with due to its novelty. 
Following the necessary consultations and declarations by the 
Supervisory Board, this recommendation will be complied with 
fully as of today.” 
On March 14, 2016, the Board of Management and Supervisory 
Board of Volkswagen AG issued a supplement to the declaration of 
conformity with the Code as required by section 161 of the AktG 
with the following wording: 
“The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board declare that: 
1) In their Declaration of Conformity dated November 20, 2015, the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG 
declared that they would fully comply with the recommendations of 
the Government Commission of the German Corporate Gover-
nance Code (DCGK) in the version dated May 5, 2015 that had been 
published by the German Ministry of Justice in the official section of 
the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on June 12, 2015, with the 
exception of the following numbers:  > a)  4.2.3 paragraph 4 (severance payment cap)  
> b) 5.1.2 paragraph 2 sentence 3 (age limit for members of the 
Board of Management) 
> c) 5.3.2 sentence 3 (independence of the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee) 
> d) 5.4.1 paragraphs 5 to 7 (disclosure regarding election recom-
mendations) 
> e) 5.4.6 paragraph 2 sentence 2 (performance-related remuner-
ation of members of the Supervisory Board) 
2) Due to the currently still unanswered questions relating to the 
consequences of the emissions issue and the resulting assessment 
questions, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board have 
decided that the 2015 consolidated financial statements and the 
interim report for the first quarter of 2016 will not be made publicly 
accessible within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year or within 45 
days of the end of the quarter. As such, the supplement to the 
Declaration of Conformity from November 20, 2015 will include an 
explanation of the deviation from number 7.1.2 sentence 4 of the 
German Corporate Governance Code (deadlines for publication). 
The deviation is limited to the publications listed and the recom-
mendation will be complied with once again as of the 2016 Half-
Yearly Financial Report.” 
On April 22, 2016, the Board of Management and Supervisory 
Board of Volkswagen AG issued a further supplement to the decla-
ration of conformity with the Code as required by section 161 of the 
AktG with the following wording: 
“The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board declare the 
following: 
1) In their Declaration of Conformity dated November 20, 2012, the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG 
declared that they would comply with the recommendations of the 
Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) in the version dated May 5, 2015 published by the 
German Ministry of Justice in the official section of the Federal 
Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on June 12, 2015, with the exception of 
the following articles:

> c) 5.3.2 sentence 3 (independence of the Audit Committee Chair-
man) 
> d) 5.4.1(5 to 7) (disclosure regarding election recommen-dations) 
> e) 5.4.6(2) sentence 2 (performance-related remuneration of 
members of the Supervisory Board) 
> 2) In their supplement to the declaration described under 1) 
above, decided on March 14, 2016, the Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG further declared 
that an exception would be made in respect of article 7.1.2 
sentence 4 of the Code (date of publication of financial state-
ments). 
> 3) The Supervisory Board today adjusted the performance targets 
and comparison parameters used to determine the variable 
remuneration for the members of the Board of Management in 
fiscal year 2015 in agreement with the individual members of the 
Board of Management. Article 4.2.3(2) sentence 8 of the Code 
excludes retroactive changes to the performance targets and com-
parison parameters for the variable remuneration components. 
However, the Supervisory Board and members of the Board of 
Management were of the opinion that continued adherence to the 
previous performance targets and comparison parameters would 
have led to results that do not adequately reflect the current 
situation of the company. A retroactive adjustment of the 
performance targets and comparison parameters was therefore 
considered advisable.  
As such, a second supplement to the Declaration of Conformity 
dated 20 November 2015 is being issued in which the company 
declares that an exception will be made in respect of article 4.2.3(2) 
sentence 8 of the Code (exclusion of retroactive changes to the com-
parison parameters).” 
The current declarations of conformity are also published on 
our website, www.volkswagenag.com/ir, under the heading “Cor-
porate Governance”, menu item “Declarations”. 
The suggestions of the current version of the German Cor-
porate Governance Code, with the exception of the suggestion in 
article 5.1.2(2) sentence 1 (Appointment period for first-time appoint-
ments to the Board of Management), are complied with in full. The 
Supervisory Board decides the appointment period for each first-
time appointment to the Board of Management on an individual 
basis, taking the best interests of the Company into account.  Our listed subsidiaries  AUDI AG, MAN SE and Renk AG have also 
issued declarations of conformity with the German Corporate 
Governance Code.  
At Scania AB, the management and supervisory functions are 
split between the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors, 
and the President and 
CEO. They are governed by the articles of 
association, Swedish company law and other laws and regulations.  
The declarations of conformity of our listed subsidiaries can be 
accessed at the websites shown on this page. In addition, further

63 COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND THE 
SUPERVISORY BOARD 
The Supervisory Board advises and monitors the Board of Manage-
ment with regard to the management of the Company. It is directly 
involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the Group. The 
Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG 
consult closely on the strategic orientation of the Volkswagen Group. 
The two boards jointly assess the progress made in implementing 
the strategy at regular intervals. The Board of Management reports 
to the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively 
in both written and oral form on all issues of relevance to strategy, 
planning, the development of the business, the risk situation, risk 
management and compliance.  
More information on the cooperation between the Board of 
Management and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG and on 
the work and structure of the committees of the Supervisory Board 
can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board on pages 12 to 
17 of this annual report. 
Information on the members of the Board of Management and 
Supervisory Board, as well as on the Supervisory Board committees, 
can be found on pages 81 to 84. 
OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD, 
BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND SENIOR EXECUTIVE POSITIONS 
In view of the purpose of the Company, its size and the extent of its 
international activities, the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG 
strives to take the following criteria into account in its composition:  
> At least three members of the Supervisory Board should be 
persons who embody in particular the characteristic of inter-
nationality.  
> At least four shareholder representative members of the Super-
visory Board should be persons who do not represent potential 
conflicts of interest, particularly conflicts of interest that could 
arise through a position as a consultant or member of the govern-
ing bodies of customers, suppliers, lenders, or other third parties. 
> In addition, at least four of the shareholder representatives must 
be persons who are independent as defined by article 5.4.2 of the 
German Corporate Governance Code. 
> Furthermore, proposals for elections should not normally include 
persons who will have reached the age of 75 by the time the 
election takes place or who have been members of the Super-
visory Board for more than 20 years by the time the election takes 
place.  The above criteria have been met. The statutory gender quota of at 
least 30% will apply to new appointments to the Supervisory Board 
of Volkswagen AG from January 1, 2016, based on the Gesetz für die 
gleichberechtigte Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern an Führungs-
positionen in der Privatwirtschaft und im öffentlichen Dienst (Act 
on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership 
Positions in the Private and Public Sectors).  
The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG has also set itself the 
longer-term goal of increasing the proportion of female members 
on the Board of Management to 30%. The Supervisory Board did 
not identify any opportunity for increasing the proportion of female 
members on the Board of Management by the end of 2016 as of the 
date stipulated in the Act for determining a specific target; as a result, 
it resolved a target quota of zero for December 31, 2016. However, 
the appointment of Dr. Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt in October 
2015 to take up the newly created Board of Management position 
for Integrity and Legal Affairs with effect from January 1, 2016 
means that a female member has been appointed to the Group’s 
Board of Management.  
Volkswagen AG has set the following target quotas to increase 
the proportion of women in management: the aim is for the pro-
portion of women in the first management level to amount to  
9.8% as of the end of 2016, with the figure for the second manage-
ment level amounting to 13.3%.   REMUNERATION REPORT

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Corporate Governance Report  
64  COMPLIANCE Compliance with international rules and the fair treatment of our 
business partners and competitors are among the guiding prin-
ciples followed by our Company. Volkswagen’s commitment has 
always gone beyond statutory and internal requirements; voluntary 
obligations and ethical principles also form an integral part of our 
corporate culture. The misconduct uncovered in the fiscal year 
2015 runs contrary to all of the values that Volkswagen stands for. 
However, our conviction remains unchanged: compliant behavior 
is a cornerstone of business success and must be self-evident for all 
Group employees. 
 
Commitment to compliance at the highest level 
This view is expressly shared by the Company’s management. The 
Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG, Matthias 
Müller, said at a Group-wide information event for management in 
November 2015 that “no business in the world justifies violating 
legal and ethical limits. Our key currency is not unit figures or the 
operating result. Our key currency is credibility and trust in our 
brands, our products and the people who work for our Company. […] 
Compliance and the rule of law are central to Volkswagen rather 
than being onerous duties, something that is confirmed by the 
creation of a new Group Board of Management position for Integ-
rity and Legal Affairs.” 
 
Preventive compliance management system 
Volkswagen has had a distinct and recognized Group-wide com-
pliance management system for a number of years. In 2015, com-
pliance continued to play an important role in the Governance, Risk 
and Compliance (
GRC) organization in the Volkswagen Group (see 
the Report on Risks and Opportunities starting on page 170).  
The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG resolved to create the 
new Board of Management position for Integrity and Legal Affairs 
from January 2016 as a visible reinforcement of compliance 
throughout the Company. Dr. Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, a 
former judge at the German Federal Constitutional Court, has been 
appointed to this position. 
Volkswagen adopts a preventive compliance approach and aims 
to create a corporate culture that is designed to prevent potential 
breaches before they occur by raising awareness and educating 
employees.  
Group Internal Audit and Group Security regularly perform the 
necessary investigative activities, systematically monitor compli-
ance and perform random checks regardless of any suspicion of 
infringements, as well as investigating specific suspected breaches. Responses are implemented by the Human Resources and Group 
Legal departments. These processes are closely interrelated, in line 
with the concept of a comprehensive compliance management 
system. Nevertheless, we are aware that even the best compliance 
management system can never entirely prevent the criminal actions 
of individuals. 
The Group Chief Compliance Officer is supported by 14 Chief 
Compliance Officers or compliance contact persons (staff who are 
responsible at the brands, Volkswagen Financial Services and 
Porsche Holding GmbH, Salzburg). They are supported by compli-
ance officers in the Group companies.  
Various bodies support the work of the compliance organi-
zation at Group and brand company level. These include the Com-
pliance Board at senior management level and the core Compliance 
team, which bundles expertise in compliance issues. 
  Focal points in 2015 
Each year, detailed compliance risk assessments are carried out 
across the Group as part of the standard 
GRC process. The results 
are factored into the risk analyses performed by the Volkswagen 
Group, the brands and the companies, and into the Compliance 
Program planning.  
We primarily continued to drive forward our work in China  
in 2015 and intensified our compliance activities at Volkswagen 
Group subsidiaries and second-tier subsidiaries. We reacted to 
events surrounding the emissions issue by adopting measures and 
launching campaigns: the brisk response by the employees to a call 
to participate in a photo campaign under the motto “Together for 
Volkswagen, Together for Compliance” demonstrated their clear 
commitment to compliance. In addition, we have strengthened the 
product-related internal compliance control system in cooperation 
with internal and external experts. Cross-departmental projects on 
this issue were initiated in particular at Technical Development. 
Detailed information about the investigations into the emissions 
issue can be found in the special chapter on pages 49 to 54 of this 
Annual Report. 
Communicating compliance 
The GRC organization provided information on various compliance 
issues to the Group’s brands and companies over the year, using a 
wide range of traditional communication channels. These include 
reports in various employee magazines produced by the brands, 
companies and locations. Digital media such as intranet portals, 
smartphone and tablets apps, blogs and newsletters are also 
frequently used to provide compliance information.

Corporate Governance Report  
 
65 We have communicated the Code of Conduct, including the 
compliance obligation, to employees at the brand companies, and 
this forms a key component of our compliance training. It is also 
integrated into our operational processes. For example, all new 
employment contracts entered into between Volkswagen AG on the 
one part and both management staff and employees covered by 
collective agreements on the other include a reference to the Code 
of Conduct and the obligation to comply with it. In addition, the 
Code of Conduct is part of employees’ annual reviews and therefore 
forms part of the calculation of variable, performance-related 
remuneration. 
In addition to the Code of Conduct, Volkswagen’s compliance 
framework incorporates the anti-corruption guidelines, including 
checklists and the express prohibition of facilitation payments, as 
well as guidelines on competition and antitrust law, among other 
things. 
Directives on dealing with gifts and invitations, as well as on 
making donations also apply across the Group. 
Learning programs, training and advice 
Providing information to employees at all levels continues to be a 
core component of our compliance work. In 2015, approximately 
193,000 employees across the Group participated in a variety of 
compliance-related topics such as the Code of Conduct, anti-
corruption, human rights, anti-money laundering, and competition 
and antitrust law. In addition to traditional lectures and e-learning 
programs, case studies, role-playing games and other interactive 
formats form an integral part of the training provided to employees 
and managers. Also, since December 2014 a management talk on 
risk management and compliance has been offered to all newly 
appointed senior managers in Group functions and the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars brand. All new Volkswagen AG employees are 
required to complete an e-learning program on the Group’s Code of 
Conduct. The subject of human rights is an integral part of this 
training program. Training on competition and antitrust law is a 
core component of Compliance work in the Volkswagen Group. 
Approximately 30,000 employees received training on this issue 
during the reporting period. Among other things, a compliance app 
for smartphones and tablets is available to Volkswagen AG’s 
employees as a self-learning solution. 
Employees of all brand companies and a large number of Group 
companies are able to obtain personal advice about compliance 
issues, usually by contacting the compliance organization via a 
dedicated e-mail address. An IT-based information and advisory 
tool is available at Volkswagen AG’s German locations. 
  Business partner check 
We also expect our business partners to act with integrity and 
ensure regulatory compliance. For this reason, Volkswagen verifies 
the integrity of its business partners (business partner check) in a 
risk-oriented approach. This check allows us to find out about 
potential business partners before entering into a relationship with 
them, reducing the risk of starting a cooperation that could be 
damaging to the Company or its business. 
 
Ombudsman system 
The Group-wide ombudsman system can be used to report any 
breaches or suspicions regarding corruption, illegal economic 
activity, or other irregularities, such as violations of human rights 
and ethical misconduct, in all major Group languages to two 
external lawyers appointed by the Group. Since 2014, employees 
providing information have had the option of communicating with 
the ombudsmen via an additional online channel; various breaches 
can be reported using a technically highly secure electronic mailbox. 
Naturally, the people providing the information need not fear being 
sanctioned by the Company for doing this. After plausibility checks, 
the ombudsmen passed on 79 reports by people – whose details 
remained confidential if requested – to Volkswagen AG’s Anti-Cor-
ruption Officer in 2015. In addition, the Anti-Corruption Officer 
and the head of Group Internal Audit received information on a 
further 111 cases directly. During local internal audits of the brands 
and Group companies, 331 reports were submitted to the Anti-Cor-
ruption Officer. All information was or is being followed up. For all 
breaches of the law and violations of internal regulations, the need 
for sanctions is reviewed and these are applied where necessary. 
In accordance with the normative standards issued by 
Deutsches Institut für Interne Revision e.V. (German Institute for 
Internal Auditing – 
DIIR), internal audit functions should be 
audited externally every five years. An external quality assessment of 
the Volkswagen Group’s internal audit system was carried out by an 
audit firm in the period between the third quarter of 2014 and the 
first quarter of 2015. In addition to central management and 
supervisory processes, this took into consideration the quality of the

wagen AG, 
AUDI AG, SEAT S.A. , Volkswagen de Mexico, Volkswagen 
Group China). The auditors confirmed that all of the internal audit 
units examined are fully compliant with the underlying 
DIIR 
Standard No. 3 “Quality management in the internal audit activity” 
and, in many areas, use leading internal audit methodologies and 
practices.  
 
Effectiveness review 
We review the effectiveness of the compliance measures taken at 
the Volkswagen Group’s brands and companies annually using an 
integrated survey, which forms part of the standardized 
GRC 
process. We check the effectiveness of selected countermeasures as 
well as management controls used to manage compliance risks. In 
addition, the continuous improvement of the compliance manage-
ment system is ensured through independent reviews by the Group 
Internal Audit function at the corporate units and the regular 
exchange of information with external bodies, for example. 
 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
Carefully managing potential risks to the Company is a key com-
ponent of our daily work. Volkswagen Group’s risk management 
system is oriented toward identifying, assessing, communicating 
and managing risks at an early stage. This system is reviewed on an 
ongoing basis and adjusted in line with new conditions as necessary. 
A detailed description of the risk management system and our 
accounting-related internal control system can be found in the Risk 
Report on pages 170 to 173 of this annual report.  
The Supervisory Board has established an Audit Committee, 
which monitors the financial accounting and reporting processes 
and the effectiveness of the internal control system, risk manage-
ment, the internal audit system and compliance, in particular. It 
also supervises the audit of financial statements, particularly the 
independence of the auditors, the additional services provided by 
the auditors, the audit engagement, the definition of the areas of 
emphasis for the audit and the agreed fee.   COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPARENCY 
The Volkswagen Group publishes a financial calendar listing all the 
relevant dates for its shareholders in its annual report and interim 
reports and on its website at www.volkswagenag.com/ir. Among 
other things, invitations to and the agendas for the shareholders’ 
meetings and any countermotions received are also available on

67 PRINCIPLES OF AND CHANGES TO BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 
REMUNERATION 
The full Supervisory Board resolves on the remuneration system 
and the total remuneration for each individual member of 
Volkswagen AG’s Board of Management on the basis of the Exec-
utive Committee’s recommendations. The remuneration of current 
members of the Board of Management complies with the require-
ments of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) 
and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance 
Code. In particular, the remuneration structure is focused on 
ensuring sustainable business growth in accordance with the 
Gesetz zur Angemessenheit der Vorstandsvergütung (VorstAG – 
German Act on the Appropriateness of Executive Board Remu-
neration) and section 87(1) of the AktG. 
The remuneration system of the members of the Board of 
Management was approved by the 50th Annual General Meeting on 
April 22, 2010 by 99.44% of the votes cast. At the same time, the 
Volkswagen Group’s positive business performance made it 
necessary in 2013 to modify and realign Board of Management 
remuneration and the comparative parameters on which it is based. 
The remuneration of the Board of Management was modified with 
the assistance of a remuneration consultant, whose independence 
has been assured by the Supervisory Board and by the Company. 
The level of the Board of Management remuneration should be 
appropriate and attractive in the context of the Company’s national 
and international peer group. Criteria include the tasks of the 
individual Board of Management member, their personal per-
formance, the economic situation, the performance of and outlook 
for the Company, as well as how customary the remuneration is 
when measured against its peer group and the remuneration 
structure that applies to other areas of Volkswagen. In this context, 
comparative studies on remuneration are conducted on a regular 
basis. 
COMPONENTS OF BOARD OF MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION 
The remuneration of the Board of Management comprises non-
performance-related and performance-related components. The 
non-performance-related components of the package ensure firstly 
a basic level of remuneration enabling the individual members of the Board of Management to perform their duties in the interests of 
the Company and to fulfill their obligation to act with proper 
business prudence without needing to focus on merely short-term 
performance targets. On the other hand, performance-related 
components, dependent among other criteria on the financial 
performance of the Company, serve to ensure the long-term impact 
of behavioral incentives. 
Upper limits are in place for both the overall remuneration and 
the performance-related remuneration components.  Non-performance-related remuneration 
The non-performance-related remuneration comprises fixed 
remuneration and fringe benefits. In addition to the basic level of 
remuneration, the fixed remuneration also includes differing levels 
of remuneration for appointments assumed at Group companies. 
The fringe benefits result from the grant of noncash benefits and 
include in particular the use of operating assets such as company 
cars and the payment of insurance premiums. Taxes due on these 
noncash benefits are mainly borne by Volkswagen AG. As compen-
sation for the loss of benefits due to the change of employer Mr. Diess 
received €5.0 million and Mr. Renschler received €11.5 million. 
The basic level of remuneration is reviewed regularly and 
adjusted if necessary. 
Performance-related remuneration 
The performance-related/variable remuneration comprises a 
business performance bonus, which relates to business perfor-
mance in the reporting period and in the preceding year, and, since 
2010, a Long-Term Incentive (
LT I) plan, which is based on the 
reporting period and the previous three fiscal years. Both com-
ponents of performance-related/variable remuneration are there-
fore calculated on a multiyear basis and reflect both positive and 
negative developments. Members of the Board of Management can 
also be awarded bonuses that reflect their individual performance. 
The amounts shown (including remuneration withheld) in the 
Board of Management table for 2015 in accordance with the 
German Commercial Code correspond to the amounts determined 
by the Supervisory Board for fiscal year 2015.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Remuneration Report  
68  The amounts shown in the Board of Management (benefits received) 
tables in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code 
correspond to the amounts paid out for the fiscal year in question. 
The amounts shown in the Board of Management (benefits 
granted) tables in accordance with the German Corporate 
Governance Code are based on a mean probability scenario at the 
beginning of fiscal year 2015. 
The Supervisory Board may cap the performance-related/ 
variable remuneration components in the event of extraordinary 
developments. 
Bonus 
The bonus rewards the positive business development of the 
Volkswagen Group. 
The business performance bonus is calculated on the basis of 
the average operating result, including the proportionate operating 
result in China, over a period of two years. A calculation floor below 
which no bonus will be paid is in place. This floor was set at  
€5.0 billion. In addition, a cap for extraordinary developments is 
explicitly provided for by limiting the maximum theoretical bonus 
which, subject to the individual performance-related bonus, is 
€6.75 million for the Chairman of the Board of Management and 
€2.5 million for the other members of the Board of Management. 
The system and the cap are regularly reviewed by the Supervisory 
Board to establish whether any adjustments are necessary. 
Accordingly, the method resolved by the Supervisory Board in 
2013 for calculating the business performance bonus for members 
of the Board of Management was changed for fiscal year 2015 and 
led to the operating result, including the proportionate operating 
result in China, for fiscal year 2015 that was used to calculate the 
business performance bonus for fiscal year 2015 being reduced  
to €0. 
In addition, the Supervisory Board may increase the theoretical 
business performance bonus, which is calculated on the basis of the 
average operating result, by up to 50% by applying individual 
adjustment factors that are not linked to the theoretical cap so as to 
reward members of the Board of Management for extraordinary 
individual performance (individual performance bonus). This may 
take into account extraordinary performance in the area of inte-
gration, or the successful implementation of special projects, for 
example. 
Long-Term Incentive (LTI) 
The amount of the  LT I depends on the achievement of the targets 
laid down in the Strategy 2018. The target areas are: 
> Leader in customer satisfaction, measured using the Customer 
Satisfaction Index, 
> Leading employer, measured using the Employee Index, 
> Unit sales growth, measured using the Growth Index, and 
> Increase in the return on sales, measured using the Return Index. 
The Customer Satisfaction Index is calculated using indicators that 
quantify the overall satisfaction of our customers with the delivering  
 dealers, new vehicles and the service operations based on the 
previous workshop visit. 
The Employee Index is determined using the “employment” 
and “productivity” indicators as well as the participation rate and 
results of employee surveys.  
The Growth Index is calculated using the “deliveries to cus-
tomers” and “market share” indicators. 
The Return Index is derived from the return on sales and the 
dividend per ordinary share. 
The indices on customer satisfaction, employees and unit sales 
are aggregated and the result is multiplied by the Return Index. This 
method ensures that the  LT I is only paid out if the Group is also 
financially successful. If the 1.5% threshold for the return on sales 
is not exceeded, the Return Index is zero. This would mean that the 
overall index for the fiscal year concerned is also zero. 
The maximum 
LT I amount is capped at €4.5 million for the 
Chairman of the Board of Management and €2.0 million for the 
other members of the Board of Management and is based on the 
four-year average of the overall indices, i.e. the reporting period 
and the three preceding years. 
An agreement was reached with Mr. Winterkorn to defer payment 
of 30% of his variable remuneration for fiscal year 2015 to 
December 31, 2016.  
In a statement dated April 22, 2016, Mr. Pötsch waived a 
portion of his variable remuneration for fiscal year 2015 in the 
amount of €2.3 million. 
OTHER AGREEMENTS 
Members of the Board of Management with contracts entered into 
on or after January 1, 2010 are entitled to payment of their normal 
remuneration for six to twelve months in the event of illness. 
Contracts entered into before that date grant remuneration for six 
months. In the event of disability, they are entitled to the retirement 
pension.  
Surviving dependents receive a widow’s pension of 66 2/3% 
and orphans’ benefits of 20% of the former member of the Board of 
Management’s pension. Contracts with members of the Board of 
Management whose first term of office begins after April 1, 2015, 
provide for an entitlement – in line with the principles of the works 
agreement that also applies to employees of Volkswagen AG covered 
by collective agreements – to a widow’s pension of 60%, an 
orphan’s benefit of 10% for half-orphans and an orphan’s benefit 
of 20% for full orphans, based in each case on the former member 
of the Board of Management’s pension. 
Withholding of variable remuneration for 2015 
At its meeting on April 22, 2016, Volkswagen AG’s Supervisory 
Board accepted the offer made by the members of the Board of 
Management to withhold 30% of the variable remuneration 
described above for fiscal year 2015 for the Board of Management 
members active on the date of the resolution and to make its 
disposal subject to future share price performance. ",,,,,,,,,,

Remuneration Report  
 
69 This will be effected by first converting the amount withheld based 
on the average share price for the 30 trading days preceding 
April 22, 2016 (initial reference price) into virtual preferred shares 
of Volkswagen AG with a three-year holding period and, at the same 
time, defining a target reference price corresponding to 125% of 
the initial reference price. During the holding period, the virtual 
preferred shares will be entitled to a dividend equivalent in the 
amount of the dividends paid on real preferred shares. 
Following the expiry of the holding period, the average share 
price for the 30 trading days preceding the last day of the holding 
period, i.e. April 22, 2019, will be determined (closing reference 
price). The difference between the target reference price and the 
initial reference price will be deducted from the closing reference price and the dividends distributed on one real Volkswagen 
preferred share during the holding period (dividend equivalent) 
will be added to the closing reference price. This ensures that – 
excluding any dividend equivalents accrued – the amount withheld 
is only paid out in full if the initial reference price of the preferred 
share has increased by at least 25%. Otherwise, the amount is 
reduced accordingly down to €0. The amount thus calculated will be 
disbursed to the members of the Board of Management. The 
amount disbursed must not be more than twice the amount 
originally withheld. Where members of the Board of Management 
retire from office before the expiry of the holding period, the 
disbursement amount will be calculated and paid out propor-
tionately based on the date of termination of employment.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Remuneration Report  
78  POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS In the event of regular termination of their service on the Board of 
Management, the members of the Board of Management are 
entitled to a pension, including a surviving dependents’ pension, as 
well as the use of company cars for the period in which they receive 
their pension. The agreed benefits are paid or made available when 
the Board of Management member reaches the age of 63. As a 
departure from this principle, Mr. Renschler is able to start 
drawing his pension when he reaches the age of 62. 
The retirement pension is calculated as a percentage of the 
basic level of remuneration. Starting at 50%, the individual 
percentage increases by two percentage points for each year of 
service. In specific cases, credit is given for previous employment 
periods and retirement pensions earned. The Supervisory Board 
has defined a maximum of 70%. These benefits are not broken 
down any further into performance-related components and long-
term incentive components. Mr. Garcia Sanz, Mr. Heizmann,  
Mr. Neumann, Mr. Pötsch and Mr. Winterkorn have a retirement 
pension entitlement of 70%, and Mr. Klingler, Mr. Renschler and 
Mr. Stadler have a retirement pension entitlement of 62% of their 
basic level of remuneration as of the end of 2015. In a departure 
from this rule, a retirement pension entitlement of 62% of the basic 
level of remuneration was set for Mr. Renschler on his appointment. 
This increases by two percentage points every year. Mr. Müller had 
a retirement pension entitlement of 50% of the basic level of 
remuneration as of the end of 2015; this increases by three percent-
age points every year. 
Mr. Diess and Mr. Witter received a defined contribution plan, 
which is based in principle on a works agreement that also applies 
to the employees of Volkswagen AG covered by collective agree-
ments and includes retirement, invalidity and surviving dependents’ 
benefits. A pension contribution in the amount of 50% of the basic 
level of remuneration is contributed to Volkswagen Pension Trust 
e.V. at the end of the calendar year for each year they are appointed 
to the Board of Management. The annual pension contributions 
result in modules of what is, in principle, a lifelong pension in line 
with the arrangements that also apply to employees covered by 
collective agreements. The individual pension modules vest imme-
diately upon contribution to Volkswagen Pension Trust e.V. Instead 
of a lifelong pension, benefits can optionally be paid out as a lump 
sum or in installments when the beneficiary reaches retirement age 
– currently 63 at the earliest. Volkswagen AG has assumed respon-
sibility for pension entitlements due to Mr. Witter from the time 
  before his service with the Company, although these cannot be 
claimed before he reaches the age of 60. 
Mr. Östling has a pension entitlement based on the deferred 
compensation arrangements administered by Volkswagen Pension 
Trust e.V. The benefits include a retirement pension payable when 
the beneficiary reaches the age of 70 and a surviving dependents’ 
pension. Volkswagen AG provides an annual remuneration-linked 
company contribution for Mr. Östling, which is converted into a 
pension module at the end of each year. 
On December 31, 2015 the pension obligations for members of 
the Board of Management in accordance with 
IAS 19 amounted to 
€86,601,704 (€138,046,434); €6,409,924 (€8,229,691) was added 
to the provision in the reporting period in accordance with 
IAS 19. 
Other benefits such as surviving dependents’ pensions and the use of 
company cars are also factored into the measurement of pension 
provisions. The pension obligations measured in accordance  
with German 
GAAP amounted to €70,161,416 (€95,992,020); 
€14,627,403 (€16,616,016) was added to the provision in the 
reporting period in accordance with German 
GAAP. Current pen-
sions are index-linked using the same method as for the highest 
collectively agreed salary, insofar as the application of section 16 of 
the Gesetz zur Verbesserung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung 
(Betr
AVG – German Company Pension Act) does not lead to a larger 
increase. 
Retired members of the Board of Management and their 
surviving dependents received €51,306,960 (€22,792,616) or 
€51,306,960 (€22,111,951) in accordance with German 
GAAP in 
the past year. Obligations for pensions for this group of persons 
measured in accordance with 
IAS 19 amounted to €242,675,809 
(€165,668,945), or €209,868,399 (€129,456,621) measured in 
accordance with German 
GAAP. 
The following rule applies to Board of Management contracts 
entered into for the first term of office before August 5, 2009: the 
retirement pension to be granted after a member of the Board of 
Management leaves the Company is payable immediately if the 
member’s contract is not renewed by the Company, and in other 
cases when the member reaches the age of 63. Any remuneration 
received from other sources until the age of 63 is deductible from 
the benefit entitlement up to a certain fixed amount. 
The following general rule applies to contracts for the first term 
of office of members of the Board of Management entered into after 
August 5, 2009: the retirement pension to be granted after a mem-
ber of the Board of Management leaves the Company is payable 
when the member reaches the age of 63.

79 EARLY TERMINATION BENEFITS 
If membership of the Board of Management is terminated for cause 
through no fault of the Board of Management member, the claims 
under Board of Management contracts entered into since Novem-
ber 20, 2009 are limited to a maximum of two years’ remuneration, 
in accordance with the recommendation in section 4.2.3(4) of the 
German Corporate Governance Code (severance payment cap). For 
Board of Management members who are commencing their third 
or later term of office, existing rights under contracts entered into 
before November 20, 2009 are grandfathered. No severance payment is made if membership of the Board of 
Management is terminated for a reason for which the Board of 
Management member is responsible. 
The members of the Board of Management are also entitled to a 
pension and to a surviving dependents’ pension as well as the use of 
company cars for the period in which they receive their pension in 
the event of early termination of their service on the Board of 
Management.  
Please refer to notes 43 and 45 to the consolidated financial 
statements for more detailed individual disclosures relating to 
members of the Board of Management who left the Company in 
fiscal year 2015.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Disclosures Required Under Takeover Law 
85 CAPITAL STRUCTURE Volkswagen AG’s share capital amounted to €1,283,315,873.28 
(€1,217,872,117.76) on December 31, 2015. It was composed of 
295,089,818 ordinary shares and 206,205,445 preferred shares. 
This includes 27,091 preferred shares created in 2015 as a result of 
the voluntary exercise of the mandatory convertible note and 
25,536,876 preferred shares from final conversion on the final 
maturity date of the convertible note. Each share conveys a notional 
interest of €2.56 in the share capital.  
 
SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS 
The shares convey pecuniary and administrative rights. The 
pecuniary rights include in particular the shareholders’ right to 
participate in profits (section 58(4) of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – Ger-
man Stock Corporation Act)), the right to participate in liquidation 
proceeds (section 271 of the AktG) and preemptive rights to shares 
in the event of capital increases (section 186 of the AktG) that can be 
disapplied by the Annual General Meeting with the approval of the 
Special Meeting of Preferred Shareholders, where appropriate. 
Administrative rights include the right to attend the Annual General 
Meeting and the right to speak there, to ask questions, to propose 
motions and to exercise voting rights. Shareholders can enforce 
these rights in particular through actions seeking disclosure and 
actions for avoidance.  
Each ordinary share grants the holder one vote at the Annual 
General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting elects shareholder 
representatives to the Supervisory Board and elects the auditors; in 
particular, it resolves the appropriation of net profit, formally 
approves the actions of the Board of Management and the Super-
visory Board, resolves amendments to the Articles of Association, 
capitalization measures and authorizations to purchase treasury 
shares; if required, it also resolves the performance of a special 
audit, the removal before the end of their term of office of 
Supervisory Board members elected at the Annual General Meeting 
and the winding-up of the Company. Preferred shareholders generally have no voting rights. However, 
in the exceptional case that they are granted voting rights by law (for 
example, when preferred share dividends were not paid in one year 
and not compensated for in full in the following year), each 
preferred share also grants the holder one vote at the Annual 
General Meeting. Furthermore, preferred shares entitle the holder 
to a €0.06 higher dividend than ordinary shares (further details on 
this right to preferred and additional dividends are specified in 
Article 27(2) of the Articles of Association). 
The Gesetz über die Überführung der Anteilsrechte an der 
Volkswagenwerk Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung in private 
Hand (VW-Gesetz – Act on the Privatization of Shares of Volks-
wagenwerk Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung) of July 21, 1960, 
as amended on July 30, 2009, includes various provisions in 
derogation of the German Stock Corporation Act, for example on 
exercising voting rights by proxy (section 3 of the VW-Gesetz) and on 
majority voting requirements at the Annual General Meeting 
(section 4(3) of the VW-Gesetz).  
In accordance with the Volkswagen AG Articles of Association 
(Article 11(1)), the State of Lower Saxony is entitled to appoint two 
members of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG for as long as 
it directly or indirectly holds at least 15% of Volkswagen AG’s 
ordinary shares. In addition, resolutions by the General Meeting 
that are required by law to be adopted by a qualified majority 
require a majority of more than four-fifths of the share capital of the 
Company represented when the resolution is adopted (Article 
25(2)), regardless of the provisions of the VW-Gesetz.  
SHAREHOLDINGS EXCEEDING 10% OF VOTING RIGHTS 
Shareholdings in Volkswagen AG that exceed 10% of voting rights 
are shown in the notes to the annual financial statements of Volks-
wagen AG, which is available online at www.volkswagenag.com/ir. 
The current notifications of changes in voting rights in accordance 
with the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG – German Securities 
Trading Act) are also published on this website.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Disclosures Required Under Takeover Law 
86  COMPOSITION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD  The Supervisory Board consists of 20 members, half of whom are 
shareholder representatives. In accordance with Article 11(1) of the 
Articles of Association of Volkswagen AG, the State of Lower Saxony 
is entitled to appoint two of these shareholder representatives for as 
long as it directly or indirectly holds at least 15% of the Company’s 
ordinary shares. The remaining shareholder representatives on the 
Supervisory Board are elected by the Annual General Meeting. 
The other half of the Supervisory Board consists of employee 
representatives elected by the employees in accordance with the 
Mitbestimmungsgesetz (MitbestG – German Codetermination Act). 
A total of seven of these employee representatives are Company 
employees elected by the workforce; the other three employee 
representatives are trade union representatives elected by the 
workforce. 
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is generally a share-
holder representative elected by the other members of the Super-
visory Board. In the event that a Supervisory Board vote is tied, the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board has a casting vote in accor-
dance with the MitbestG. 
The goals for the composition of the Supervisory Board are 
described on page 63 of the Corporate Governance Report. Infor-
mation about the composition of the Supervisory Board at the end 
of the reporting period can be found on pages 82 to 84 of this 
annual report. 
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARTICLES 
OF ASSOCIATION WITH REGARD TO THE APPOINTMENT AND 
REMOVAL OF BOARD OF MANAGEMENT MEMBERS AND TO 
AMENDMENTS TO THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION 
The appointment and removal of members of the Board of 
Management are governed by sections 84 and 85 of the AktG, which 
specify that members of the Board of Management are appointed by 
the Supervisory Board for a maximum of five years. Board of 
Management members may be reappointed or have their term of 
office extended for a maximum of five years in each case. In 
addition, Article 6 of the Articles of Association states that the 
number of Board of Management members is stipulated by the 
Supervisory Board and that the Board of Management must consist 
of at least three persons. 
The Annual General Meeting resolves amendments to the 
Articles of Association (section 119(1) of the AktG). In accordance 
with section 4(3) of the VW-Gesetz as amended on July 30, 2009 
and Article 25(2) of the Articles of Association, Annual General 
Meeting resolutions to amend the Articles of Association require a 
majority of more than four-fifths of the share capital represented. 
POWERS OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT, IN PARTICULAR 
CONCERNING THE ISSUE OF NEW SHARES AND THE REPURCHASE 
OF TREASURY SHARES 
According to German stock corporation law, the Annual General 
Meeting can, for a maximum of five years, authorize the Board of  
 Management to issue new shares. It can also authorize the Board of 
Management, for a maximum of five years, to issue bonds on the 
basis of which new shares are to be issued. The Annual General 
Meeting also decides the extent to which shareholders have 
preemptive rights to the new shares or bonds. The highest amount 
of authorized share capital or contingent capital available for these 
purposes is determined by Article 4 of the Articles of Association of 
Volkswagen AG, as amended.  
The Annual General Meeting on April 19, 2012 resolved to 
authorize the Board of Management, with the consent of the Super 
visory Board, to increase the Company’s share capital by a total of 
up to €110.0 million (corresponding to approximately 43 million 
shares) on one or more occasions up to April 18, 2017 by issuing 
new ordinary and/or nonvoting preferred bearer shares – including 
with shareholders’ preemptive rights disapplied – against cash and/ 
or noncash contributions. This authorization was partially exercised 
in June 2014 by way of a capital increase through the issuance of 
10,471,204 new preferred shares from authorized capital against 
cash contributions, while disapplying shareholders’ preemptive 
rights. This increased the share capital by €26.8 million and 
generated gross proceeds of €2.0 billion.  
The Board of Management’s authorization to increase the share 
capital by up to a total of €179.4 million on one or more occasions by 
issuing new nonvoting preferred shares against cash contributions 
expired on December 2, 2014. In order to renew this capital, the 
General Meeting on May 5, 2015 resolved to authorize the Board of 
Management, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to 
increase the Company’s share capital by a total of up to €179.2 mil-
lion (corresponding to 70 million shares) on one or more occasions 
up to May 4, 2020 by issuing new nonvoting preferred shares against 
cash contributions.  
Furthermore, it was possible for the share capital to be 
increased by up to €102.4 million by issuing nonvoting preferred 
shares, in order to settle the conversion or option rights of holders 
or creditors of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants issued 
before April 21, 2015. This authorization was partially exercised in 
November 2012 and in June 2013 by issuing mandatory convertible 
notes. The mandatory convertible notes were converted on maturity 
(November 9, 2015). 
Further details on the authorization to issue new shares and 
their permitted uses may be found in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 253. 
Opportunities to acquire treasury shares are governed by 
section 71 of the AktG. The Board of Management was most recently 
authorized to acquire treasury shares up to a maximum of 10% of 
the share capital at the Annual General Meeting on April 19, 2012. 
This authorization applies until April 18, 2017 and has not so far 
been exercised.

87 MATERIAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY IN THE EVENT 
OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL FOLLOWING A TAKEOVER BID  A banking syndicate granted Volkswagen AG a syndicated credit line 
amounting to €5.0 billion that runs until April 2020. The syndicate 
members were granted the right to call their portion of the 
syndicated credit line if Volkswagen AG is merged with a third party 
or becomes a subsidiary of another company. However, this call 
right does not apply in the event of a merger by absorption of 
Porsche Holding SE, one of its subsidiaries, or one of its holding 
companies and Volkswagen AG in which Volkswagen AG is the 
acquiring legal entity.  
In addition, Volkswagen AG agreed a supplementary syndicated 
credit line of up to €20.0 billion, initially running until December 
2016, with a banking syndicate. The syndicate members were 
granted the right to call their portion of the syndicated credit line if 
Volkswagen AG is merged with a third party or group of third parties, 
or becomes a subsidiary of another company or group of other 
companies. Exceptions to this call right were agreed with regard to 
various combinations involving the current majority shareholders.  RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF SHARES 
As part of the cooperative agreement Volkswagen AG and Suzuki 
Motor Corporation agreed mutual approval and preemptive tender 
rights in the event that the shares held by the other contracting 
party were to be sold. The arbitration court established on 
August 29, 2015 that the parties had the right to give regular notice 
to terminate the cooperation agreement, had exercised this right, 
and that the partnership had been terminated. Volkswagen 
consequently sold its 19.9% equity investment in Suzuki to Suzuki 
on September 17, 2015 at the quoted market price of €3.1 billion. 
The 1.5% of ordinary Volkswagen AG shares held by Suzuki Motor 
Corporation were transferred to Porsche Automobil Holding SE in 
an off-market transaction at the end of September 2015. As a result, 
the mutual approval and preemptive tender rights ceased to apply.

GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SEE MODERATE GROWTH 
The moderate growth rate of the global economy declined to  
2.5 (2.7)% in fiscal year 2015. While the economic situation in the 
industrialized nations improved slightly, the economic perfor-
mance in many emerging economies declined in the course of the 
year. Overall, inflation persisted at a low level despite the expan-
sionary monetary policies of many central banks. Although the 
comparatively low energy and commodity prices weighed on the 
economies of individual exporting countries that depend on them, 
their effect on the global economy as a whole was supportive. 
 
Europe/Other markets 
In Western Europe, economic recovery continued: gross domestic 
product (
GDP) rose by 1.6 (1.3)% year-on-year in 2015. Most North-
ern European countries saw solid economic growth. In most 
Southern European countries, the economic situation stabilized 
amid increasing rates of expansion. The eurozone’s unemployment 
rate fell to 11.5 (12.1)%, although it remained significantly above 
the average in Greece and Spain. 
In Central and Eastern Europe, 
GDP growth decreased by an 
average of 0.7 (+1.8)% in the reporting period. While Central 
Europe proceeded on a positive growth path, Eastern Europe expe-
rienced a recessionary trend. In addition to the conflict between 
Russia and Ukraine and the resulting uncertainties, falling energy 
prices had a negative impact on the region overall. In Russia, 
economic output dropped significantly, by 3.9 (+0.6)%, in the 
reporting period.  
South Africa’s 
GDP expanded by 1.4 (1.5)%, thus falling some-
what short of the relatively low figure for the previous year. The 
country’s economic performance continued to be negatively 
impacted by structural deficits and social conflicts. 
Germany  
The German economy benefited from positive consumer sentiment 
and the stable labor market in 2015. Despite the weak euro, exports failed to boost growth in any significant way.  GDP expanded by 
1.5 (1.6)%, somewhat weaker than in the previous year.  
 
North America 
Following a robust first half of 2015, economic growth in the US lost 
some of its momentum as the year progressed. The economy was 
supported primarily by private consumer demand and expan-
sionary monetary policies. The unemployment rate continued the 
positive trend of the previous year, falling to 5.0 (5.6)% by the end 
of the year. The US dollar remained strong, putting goods exports 
under pressure. Overall, as in the previous year, the US economy 
expanded by 2.4%. Canada’s 
GDP growth slowed significantly to a 
mere 1.2 (2.5)%. The Mexican economy’s rate of growth was almost 
unchanged at 2.4 (2.3)%. 
 
South America 
After generating only negligible growth in the previous year, Brazil 
entered a recession in the reporting period. Both the country’s 
weak domestic demand and low global commodity prices had a 
negative impact on performance. Economic output declined by 
3.7 (+0.1)%. Although Argentina’s 
GDP stabilized, growing by 
1.6 (0.5)%, structural deficits and persistently high inflation 
continued to weigh on the economy. 
 
Asia-Pacific 
The Chinese economy expanded by 6.9 (7.3)% in 2015. Although 
losing momentum, primarily due to structural changes, it remained 
at a high level compared with the rest of the world. The Indian 
economy continued its positive trend with a gain of 7.2 (7.3)% and 
thereby grew as strongly as in the previous year. Growth in Japan’s 
GDP was relatively weak at 0.7 (–0.1)% due to weak domestic and 
international demand. At 4.3 (4.4)%, growth in the 
ASEAN region 
remained at the prior-year level.  
 
 
  
 
  
B
usiness  Developmen t 


In fiscal year 2015, the global economy grew at a moderate rate, slightly below that of the previous 
year. Global demand for vehicles continued to rise. Amid increasingly difficult conditions in some 
relevant markets, deliveries to Volkswagen Group’s customers were down slightly year-on-year.

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR PASSENGER CARS REACHES NEW HIGH 
Worldwide, the number of new passenger car registrations increased 
slightly by 2.6% to 75.6 million vehicles in fiscal year 2015, exceed-
ing the previous year’s record level. While Western Europe, Central 
Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region recorded 
significant increases in some cases, volumes in the passenger car 
markets in Eastern Europe and South America were again down 
substantially on the previous year.  
 
Sector-specific environment 
The global passenger car markets turned in a very mixed per-
formance in the reporting period: demand recovered in important 
sales countries in Western Europe, the Chinese market expanded 
somewhat more slowly than in previous years and Russia and Brazil 
saw considerable declines. 
The sector-specific environment was to a significant extent 
influenced by fiscal policy measures, which contributed substan-
tially to the mixed trends in sales volumes in the markets in the past 
fiscal year. The instruments used for this were tax reductions or 
increases, incentive programs and sales incentives as well as import 
duties. 
In addition, non-tariff trade barriers to protect the respective 
domestic automotive industry made the free movement of vehicles, 
parts and components more difficult. Protectionist tendencies were 
particularly evident where markets were on the decline.  Europe/Other markets 
The passenger car market in Western Europe continued its catch-
up process in the reporting period. At 13.2 million vehicles (+9.0%), 
the volume of new registrations reached its highest level in six years, 
although – compared to the pre-crisis years from 1998 to 2007 – it 
was still at a low level. This development was primarily due to 
positive consumer sentiment, an improved macroeconomic 
environment, low fuel prices as well as the reduction in pent-up 
demand. While demand for passenger cars in Spain (+20.9%)  
– which benefited from government stimulus measures – and Italy 
(+15.5%) saw double-digit growth rates, volumes in the passenger 
car markets in France (+6.8%) and the UK (+6.3%) rose 
comparatively moderately.  
In Central and Eastern Europe, the total number of new 
passenger car registrations fell sharply in fiscal year 2015, by 
23.3%, to 2.8 million vehicles. The decline in demand in Eastern 
Europe was primarily attributable to the massive slump in the 
Russian passenger car market, which contracted for the third year 
in succession due to the difficult economic and political situation. 
By contrast, the volume of demand in the Central European EU 
countries rose substantially, by 10.7% to 1.0 million units.  
In South Africa, the number of passenger cars sold in 2015 fell 
by 5.8% to 414 thousand vehicles. The main reasons were a 
difficult economic environment, a rise in interest rates and a lack of 
consumer confidence.

Germany 
In Germany, 3.2 million new passenger vehicles were registered in 
2015, 5.6% more than in the previous year. This development 
primarily resulted from positive consumer sentiment, the strong 
labor market as well as a decline in fuel prices and low interest rates. 
This market volume – the highest since 2009 – was exclusively attri-
butable to new registrations for business customers (+8.8%), while 
demand from private customers stagnated (–0.1%). The increase in 
passenger vehicle exports (+2.4% to 4.4 million vehicles), espe-
cially to Western European markets, facilitated the increase in 
domestic production (+1.9% to 5.7 million vehicles). 
 
North America 
At 20.7 million vehicles (+6.1%), sales of passenger vehicles and 
light commercial vehicles (up to 6.35 tonnes) in North America 
exceeded the 20 million unit mark for the first time in the reporting 
period. In the USA, the market volume grew by 5.7% to 17.5 million 
passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles, reaching an all-
time high. The main reasons were high consumer confidence, 
positive employment and income development as well as favorable 
financing conditions. Demand was particularly strong for models in 
the SUV and pickup segments, which benefited additionally from 
the low fuel prices.  
In Canada, the sales figures increased slightly by 2.6% to 1.9 
million vehicles, thus beating the record set in the previous year.  
Demand in the Mexican automotive market increased in fiscal 
year 2015. The number of passenger vehicles and light commercial  
 vehicles sold rose significantly by 17.6% to a new record level of 1.3 
million units. 
  South America 
In South America, demand for passenger vehicles decreased for the 
third year in succession in fiscal year 2015, dropping by 21.2% to 
3.1 million units. The significant decline of the market as a whole 
was primarily attributable to the massive collapse in demand in 
Brazil, where the number of new registrations fell by 27.4% to 1.8 
million vehicles. In addition to the tax increase on industrial pro-
ducts implemented at the beginning of the year, the persistent 
economic crisis and higher interest rates were the main causes of 
the lowest level of new passenger vehicle registrations since 2006. 
The weakness of the local currency, the real, was one of the factors 
driving the increase in Brazilian vehicle exports, which rose by  
24.8% to 417 thousand units.  
In Argentina, the volume of the passenger vehicle market fell by 
7.2% year-on-year to 429 thousand vehicles. High passenger car 
taxation, an increasing reluctance to buy because of falling real 
incomes and the persistent shortage of foreign currency continued 
to have a negative effect on demand. 
 
Asia-Pacific 
In the Asia-Pacific region, the number of new passenger car 
registrations continued to increase in the past fiscal year, albeit 
more slowly. Growth in the Chinese market also lost momentum as 
the economy slowed down. With a plus of 7.7% to 19.2 million units,

91 the world’s largest single market nevertheless saw the largest 
increase in absolute terms. Contributing factors were persistently 
strong demand for attractively priced entry-level models in the 
SUV 
segment and the tax relief on the purchase of vehicles with engine 
sizes of up to 1.6 l that was introduced on October 1, 2015.  
In the Indian market, at 2.6 million passenger vehicles the 
volume of demand was up 8.3% over the previous year. A favorable 
consumer climate, reduced interest rates and low fuel prices con-
tributed to the increase. 
In Japan, the number of new vehicle registrations fell by 10.2% 
to 4.2 million vehicles. In addition to pull-forward effects from the 
value added tax increase on April 1, 2014, which had had a positive 
impact in the previous year, the tax increase on mini vehicles (up to 
660 cc) effective April 1, 2015 dampened domestic demand during 
2015. 
In the 
ASEAN region, passenger car sales declined by a total of 
2.5% to 2.2 million units, due primarily to a slump in demand in 
Indonesia.  
REGIONAL DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL VEHICLES MIXED 
In 2015, demand for light commercial vehicles was down on the 
previous year: in total, around 10.3 (11.3) million vehicles were 
registered worldwide.  
In the Western European markets, demand followed a positive 
trend, driven by the economic recovery. Totaling 1.7 million units, 
the number of new vehicle registrations was 10.5% higher than in 
the previous year. The highest growth rates were recorded in Spain 
(+ 34.7%), Italy (+17.2%) and the United Kingdom (+15.0%). In 
Germany, the 2014 figure was exceeded by 4.0%.  
Central and Eastern Europe, by contrast, saw a significant 
decline, with 278 (331) thousand vehicles registered. As a result of 
political tensions and their impact on the economy, demand in 
Russia was down sharply on the previous year. However, many 
smaller Central European markets continued to record growth.  
For North America, the ""light vehicle market"" is reported as part 
of the passenger car market, which includes both passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles up to 6.35 tonnes. 
In the South American market, registrations of light commer-
cial vehicles decreased to 1.1 million units (–13.9%) in the reporting 
period. This is due to the difficult economic conditions in the region. 
In Brazil, demand fell considerably short of the 2014 figure. In 
Argentina, the number of new registrations was 4.9% lower than in 
the previous year. 
At 6.1 million units (–12.6%), demand for light commercial 
vehicles in the Asia-Pacific region was down on the previous year’s 
figure. In China, the region’s dominant market, fewer vehicles 
were registered than in the year before; here, 3.6 (4.4) million units 
were registered. The decline is primarily due to the slowdown in 
industrial production and to lower investments. The market volume 
fell in India (–7.8%). Here, the market for light commercial 
  vehicles did not benefit from the economic reforms following the 
2014 elections. In Japan, the increase in value added tax and the 
resulting pull-forward effects in 2014 led to a noticeable decrease in 
the number of registrations in the reporting period.  
In the  ASEAN region, demand for light commercial vehicles was 
mixed; the volume was down slightly on the prior-year level.  
Global demand for mid-sized and heavy trucks with a gross weight 
of more than six tonnes fell significantly short of the prior-year level 
in fiscal year 2015. In total, there were 2.2 million new vehicle 
registrations, 9.1% fewer than in 2014. The volume of vehicles 
dropped by 11.3% in the markets that are relevant for the Volks-
wagen Group.  
In Western Europe, the number of truck registrations rose by 
14.4% to a total of 258 thousand vehicles. Due for the most part to 
the low prior-year level and supported by positive economic momen-
tum, the markets in Spain (+38.3%), the Netherlands (+32.3%) 
and Italy (+26.5%) in particular recorded high growth rates. In 
Germany, Western Europe’s largest market, the prior-year figure 
was exceeded by a moderate amount. 
In Central and Eastern Europe, the number of new vehicle 
registrations decreased by 16.9% to 117 thousand units. While the 
markets in Central Europe expanded, Eastern Europe was on the 
decline. In Russia, the tense and uncertain political situation, the 
economic decline, currency weakness and difficult financing 
conditions caused the number of new registrations to come in  
44.2% below the prior-year level, at 45 thousand.  
In North America, public and private spending in the 
construction and industrial sectors as well as favorable financing 
conditions boosted the positive trend in demand; in this region, 531 
(483) thousand mid-sized and heavy trucks (6.35 tonnes or more) 
were registered. In the US market, the number of new registrations 
increased by 10.5% to 456 thousand units.  
South America saw a considerable decline in market volume. 
Here, the number of new vehicle registrations fell by 36.3% to 127 
thousand units. In Brazil, the region’s largest market, demand, at 
68 (133) thousand  vehicles,  was  down significantly on the prior-
year level as a result of declining economic output and more 
restrictive financing conditions. The market in Argentina expanded 
by 14.7% to 17 thousand vehicles, but remained at a low level 
because of the economic downturn. 
At 521 (459) thousand registrations, the volume of vehicles in 
the Asia-Pacific region – excluding the Chinese market – was sig-
nificantly higher than in the previous year. Demand in India 
increased in the reporting period: a total of 266 thousand units 
were registered, 32.4% more than in 2014. This was attributable to 
demand for replacement vehicles in the heavy truck segment, rising 
infrastructure spending and the improved investment climate. 
Demand in China, the world’s largest truck market, was down 
significantly in the reporting period at a total of 539 thousand units,

92  a year-on-year decline of 32.2%. This was due to the slower 
economic growth as well as the pull-forward effects in 2014 from 
the introduction of the C4 emission standard.  
Demand for buses, both globally and in the markets that are 
relevant for the Volkswagen Group, was lower than in the previous 
year. Negative economic trends in Russia and South America led to 
a sharp decline in demand, but the markets in Western Europe 
expanded considerably.  
 
TRENDS IN THE MARKET FOR POWER ENGINEERING 
The markets for power engineering are subject to differing regional 
and economic factors. Consequently, their business growth trends 
are generally independent of each other.  
The merchant shipbuilding market again saw muted order 
activity in the reporting period. The slowdown in China’s economic 
growth and existing overcapacity had a negative impact on the 
entire merchant fleet. Bulk carriers in particular were affected by 
low freight rates. In the container ship sector, an increasing 
amount of capacity was decommissioned. Despite this, some new 
orders for ships with very high transport capacity were recorded. 
Because of their size, these types of vessels have lower operating 
costs and are primarily intended for use on fixed trade routes. The 
tanker segment benefited from positive market expectations and an 
increase in freight rates in 2015 compared with the previous year. A 
factor contributing to improving the income situation of shipping 
companies in the past year was that the currently low freight rates 
were offset by favorable fuel prices. On the other hand, the low oil 
price discourages investments in oil production in the offshore 
sector, which has led to a massive decline in ship building in this 
segment. Demand for cruise ships followed a positive trend. Gas-
fueled ships were ordered for the first time last year as a means of 
reducing emissions and meeting environmental requirements. The 
special market for government vessels also continued to follow a 
consistently positive trend. China, Korea and Japan remained the 
dominant shipbuilding countries, accounting for a global market 
share of more than 80% measured in terms of tonnage ordered. 
The marine market as a whole declined significantly compared with 
the previous year. 
Although there was continuing high demand for energy solu-
tions in developing countries and emerging markets, the more 
difficult financing conditions and regional crises led to longer 
project lead times. Regions such as the Middle East, Africa and 
Southeast Asia remained relevant markets. Due to the availability of 
shale gas, the North American market continued to grow in 
importance. Demand for decentralized diesel and gas engine 
power plants was lower overall than in the previous year, while the 
shift away from oil-fired power plants towards dual-fuel and gas-
fired plants continued.  The market for the construction of turbomachinery is mainly 
dominated by investment projects in oil and gas, the processing 
industry and power generation. The persistently low oil price 
caused leading oil and gas companies to slash investment, leading 
to project postponements or even cancellations. Even the pro-
cessing industry suffered from low investment volumes because of 
the slowdown in growth in emerging markets and existing over-
capacity in some industries, for example in the steel industry. 
Insufficient capacity utilization at many manufacturers and the low 
Japanese yen exchange rate led to increased competition. Overall, 
the market volume for turbomachinery in 2015 was below the 
prior-year level. 
As in previous years, the market for offshore wind farms in 
Germany was characterized by uncertainty with regard to financing, 
infrastructure links and the government’s incentive policies, so that 
only few projects reached the award stage.  
The after-sales market performed positively overall.  
DEMAND FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES  
Global demand for automotive-related financial services remained 
high in fiscal year 2015. Customers are increasingly optimizing 
their total spend on personal mobility, so the trend toward just 
using a car occasionally, rather than actually buying one, continued. 
Demand for new mobility services such as carsharing continued to 
grow. 
In Europe, business with financial services products was 
buoyed by the good overall performance in Germany and signs of 
recovery in Western and Central Europe. These offset the negative 
effects from the declining unit sales volumes in Russia. 
After-sales products such as maintenance and spare parts 
agreements as well as insurance agreements saw an encouraging 
rise in demand. Sales of financial services were bolstered by higher 
vehicle sales, which resulted in particular from a recovery of the 
Spanish and Italian markets. Demand for financial services bene-
fited considerably from the still high penetration rates. 
The finance and leasing business grew again in Germany in the 
fiscal year. Alongside traditional finance products, expanding the 
insurance and service business was a particular focus. 
In North America, demand for financial services in fiscal year 
2015 was also up again on the previous year. In the 
USA, the market 
for new vehicle financing registered slower growth, while the 
market for leasing through captive financial service providers 
continued to grow. In Mexico, sales volumes for financial services 
products reached a new all-time high, driven by increased cus-
tomer interest.

93 In Brazil, the negative macroeconomic trend worsened further  
in 2015 compared with the previous year. This trend was also 
increasingly apparent in lending for new cars. Although the 
Consorcio product – a lottery-style savings plan – was very popular, 
it was also impacted by declining volumes in the passenger car 
market. In Argentina, structural deficits and very high inflation 
continued to dent sales of automotive-related financial services. 
The Asia-Pacific region again saw growth in 2015. Many buyers 
used financial services to realize their wish for a car. In China, the 
proportion of loan-financed vehicle purchases continued to rise in 
the past year. Despite increasing restrictions on registrations in 
metropolitan areas, there is still considerable potential to acquire 
new customers for automotive-related financial services, particu-
larly in the interior of the country. Australia, India, Korea and South 
Africa registered growth in demand for financial services, while 
demand in the Japanese market remained stable at a high level.  
The financial services market in the commercial vehicles 
segment continued to see a trend towards optimizing total costs in 
the mid-sized and heavy commercial vehicles category in 2015. 
Innovative transport solutions are becoming increasingly impor-
tant to customers for differentiating between providers. Demand 
for financial services products rose year-on-year despite declining 
overall demand for vehicles in the relevant markets. The significant 
decline in truck and bus unit sales in South America had a negative 
impact, particularly in the core Brazilian market. However, this was 
offset by positive business growth in Europe.  
NEW GROUP MODELS IN 2015 
The Volkswagen Group selectively expanded its model portfolio in 
key segments in the reporting period. In addition, successor and 
product upgrades were presented for important brand models, 
many of them based on the Modular Transverse Toolkit. The 
Group’s range now comprises 337 passenger car, commercial 
vehicle and motorcycle models, and their derivatives. The Group’s 
product range covers almost all key segments and body types, with 
offerings from small cars to super sports cars in the passenger car 
segment, and from pickups to heavy trucks and buses in the 
commercial vehicles segment, as well as motorcycles. We will 
continue to resolutely move into unoccupied market segments that 
offer profitable opportunities for us.  
In fiscal year 2015, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand 
launched the successor of the popular Touran family van, whose 
many innovations continue the model’s success story. The new Golf 
and Passat Alltrack models use 
4MOTION drive technology to 
achieve convincing performance on any terrain. The family- 
 friendly Sharan has been enhanced by adding numerous new 
convenience and assistance systems as well as innovative infotain-
ment systems. The new Passat  GTE with a plug-in hybrid drive 
expands the range of vehicles that run on electric power. It offers 
modern, environmentally conscious customers maximum driving 
pleasure without compromising on comfort and quality. The Volks-
wagen Passenger Cars brand met special customer and market 
requirements in key regions outside Europe through product 
upgrades and country-specific models. China saw the launch of the 
dynamic and comfortable Lamando and the versatile Gran Santana, 
both manufactured locally. The sporty Golf 
GTI and Polo GTI models 
complement the local product range. The successful family saloons, 
the Sagitar and the Lavida, were upgraded, as were their derivatives, 
the Gran Lavida and the Cross Lavida. Moreover, imports of the 
innovative Golf 
GTE with a plug-in hybrid drive and the upgraded 
Touareg were launched in China in the year under review. In South 
America, the Golf family was expanded by adding the versatile Golf 
Estate. In the 
USA, the spacious Golf Estate and the uncompro-
misingly sporty Golf R were launched. 
As for the Audi brand, the new generation of the popular Audi 
A4 and Audi A4 Avant models had their world premieres in 2015. 
With the new Q7 premium class 
SUV, Audi once again shows off its 
expertise in lightweight construction and efficiency technology as 
well as in infotainment and assistance systems. For the first time, 
Audi is offering a hybrid version in this segment: the Q7 e-tron 3.0 
TDI quattro will be available for orders from spring 2016 onwards. 
The new R8 Coupé is Audi’s impressive sporty flagship model, 
offering racing technology in series-produced cars. The Audi RS 3 
Sportback was presented as the sportiest version of the A3 series. 
The third generation of the TT family was expanded by adding the 
TT Roadster and the sporty versions 
TTS Coupé and TTS Roadster. 
With the launch of the next generation of the Superb saloon and 
the Superb Combi, ŠKODA’s model portfolio entered a new era in 
2015. The Fabia Combi boasts a fresh design and boot space that 
sets standards in its class. The sporty Octavia RS 230 is at the fore-
front of the RS series. 
At the SEAT brand, the popular Ibiza small car, the Toledo four-
door coupé and the Alhambra family van were upgraded in the 
reporting period. The sporty Leon ST Cupra estate complements 
the Leon family. 
In 2015, Porsche expanded its 911 series with the all-out super 
sports car 911 GT3 RS and the dynamic Targa 4 
GTS. The new 
Macan series has been expanded with a sporty 
GTS version. In 
addition, the new Boxster Spyder, the new Cayman GT4 and the 
successor of the Cayenne Turbo S were launched.

The Lamborghini brand presented four new super sports cars: 
the newly developed Aventador LP 750-4 Superveloce, the roadster 
version of the Aventador Superveloce, the Aventador LP 700-4 
Pirelli Edition and the Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4 Spyder.  
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles introduced the new version 
of the versatile, popular Multivan/Transporter in the reporting 
period. The Caddy, an all-rounder, was upgraded. Equipped with a 
1.4 l 
TGI natural gas-powered drive, the successor to the popular 
Caddy EcoFuel was launched. The Cross Caddy has been succeeded 
by the Caddy Alltrack which is once again available as a passenger 
car or as a delivery van. 
Scania presented a Euro 6 hybrid truck, a series five-cylinder 
in-line engine running on bioethanol and two new nine-liter 
engines for truck models in fiscal year 2015. Other new products 
were the Scania Citywide Hybrid low-floor bus and the new Scania 
Interlink bus series. 
In the reporting period, MAN launched the new 
MAN Lion’s 
Intercity bus, which boasts safety and comfort features for intercity 
transport passengers and a high level of efficiency; its cockpit was 
rigorously designed in line with driver needs. 
The third generation of the Multistrada 1200 and 1200 S has 
been available from Ducati since the beginning of 2015. Four 
versions of the Scrambler series were launched: Icon, Urban

PASSENGER CAR DELIVERIES WORLDWIDE 
With its brands, the Volkswagen Group has a presence in all 
relevant automotive markets around the world. Western Europe, 
China, the 
USA, Brazil and Mexico are currently the key sales 
markets for the Group. Thanks to our wide range of attractive and 
efficient vehicles, we have a strong position amid persistently 
challenging competition.  
Under increasingly difficult conditions in relevant markets, 
such as Brazil, China and Russia, deliveries of passenger cars to 
customers amounted to 9,320,681 units in the reporting period, 
1.8% fewer than in the previous year. The passenger car market as 
a whole expanded by 2.6% in 2015, which meant that the Volks-
wagen Group’s share of the global market declined to 12.3 (12.9)%. 
The Volkswagen Group achieved the highest growth in absolute 
terms in Germany. Our sales figures in Brazil, China and Russia 
were impacted significantly by low demand. In the fourth quarter of 
2015, the emissions issue affected the individual markets in 
Western Europe and in the USA and Canada in different ways, 
depending on the brand and market. The Audi (+3.6%), 
ŠKODA 
(+1.8%), Porsche (+18.6%) and Lamborghini (+28.3%) brands 
increased their delivery figures year-on-year, setting new records. 
SEAT also recorded growth of 2.4% on the prior-year figure.

Deliveries in Europe/Other markets 
The recovery of Western Europe’s passenger car market as a whole 
continued in 2015, with growth of 9.0%. The Volkswagen Group’s 
deliveries to customers increased by 5.1% to 3,062,368 units in 
this region. Demand for Group models was up year-on-year in all 
major markets in this region. The Golf Sportsvan, Passat and 
ŠKODA Fabia models recorded the highest growth rates. In addition, 
demand for the Polo, Golf, Tiguan, Audi A3, Audi TT, 
ŠKODA Octavia 
and Porsche Macan models was particularly strong. The new 
Touran, Audi A4, Audi Q7 and 
ŠKODA Superb models were 
successfully launched on the market. The Group’s share of the 
passenger car market in Western Europe was 24.4 (25.1)%. 
In Central and Eastern Europe, we handed over –
 7.7% fewer 
passenger cars to customers in 2015 than in the year before. This 
region’s market as a whole contracted by 23.3% in the same period. 
The Group’s sales figures in Russia and Ukraine declined massively 
as a result of the difficult economic and political situation in the two 
countries. In the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Romania, 
meanwhile, we recorded strong growth in some cases. The Golf 
Sportsvan, Audi Q7, 
ŠKODA Fabia Combi and SEAT Leon ST models 
recorded the highest growth rates. The Group’s share of the passen-
ger car market in Central and Eastern Europe increased to 
20.3 (16.9)%. In the South African passenger car market, which is still on the 
decline, the number of Volkswagen Group vehicles delivered to 
customers in 2015 was down 9.4% on the previous year. The up!, 
Polo, Golf and Audi A4 saloon models recorded strong demand. 
Demand for Group vehicles in the Middle East region grew by 
18.7% compared with the previous year. The Polo, Golf, Jetta, 
Passat and  ŠKODA Octavia models were particularly popular. 
Deliveries in Germany 
The German passenger car market continued to recover in 2015, 
expanding by 5.6%. The Volkswagen Group’s performance in its 
home market was similarly positive; sales to customers increased by 
5.0% year-on-year to 1,147,484 units. The highest growth rates 
were achieved by the Passat, Audi TT, Audi Q7, 
ŠKODA Fabia Combi 
and 
ŠKODA Superb saloon models. The Polo, Golf, Golf Sportsvan, 
Audi A4 and Porsche Macan models also enjoyed great popularity. 
At the end of 2015, eight Volkswagen Group models led the 
Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (
KBA – German Federal Motor Transport 
Authority) registration statistics in their respective segments: up!, 
Polo, Golf, Tiguan, Touran, Passat, Audi TT and Audi A6. The Golf 
remained the most popular passenger car in Germany in terms of 
registrations.

Deliveries in North America 
In North America, the Volkswagen Group benefited from the 
market’s positive overall performance; it sold 922,774 vehicles in 
the reporting period, 4.3% more than in the previous year. The 
Group’s share of the passenger car market amounted to 4.5 (4.6)%. 
The Jetta was the Group’s best-selling model in North America. 
In the US market, demand for Group models rose slightly in 
2015, increasing by 1.2% year-on-year. The market as a whole 
increased by 5.7% in the same period. Models in the 
SUV and 
pickup segments remained in particularly high demand. Demand 
for the Golf, Tiguan, Audi A3, Audi Q3, Audi Q5 and Porsche Macan 
models recorded positive growth. 
In the Canadian market, which saw slight growth, we delivered 
8.8% more vehicles to customers in the reporting period than in 
the previous year. The Jetta remained the most sought-after Group 
model, while the Golf, Tiguan, Audi Q3 and Audi Q5 also recorded 
encouraging demand.  
In the fast-growing Mexican market, the Group’s sales were up 
11.9% year-on-year. The Vento and Jetta were especially popular.  
Deliveries in South America 
Conditions in the highly competitive South American markets were 
again very challenging in fiscal year 2015. In the generally sharply 
declining markets in this region, sales amounted to 489,636 units; 
this represents a decrease of 29.0% in demand for Group models  
 compared with the previous year. The Volkswagen Group’s share of 
the passenger car market in this region declined to 15.7 (17.4)%. 
In the Brazilian passenger car market, which has suffered 
massive declines, the Volkswagen Group delivered 36.3% fewer 
vehicles than in the year before. The best-selling models were the 
up!, Fox, Gol, Saveiro and Audi A3.  
In Argentina, the downward trend of the market as a whole 
slowed in the course of 2015. Demand for Volkswagen Group 
models increased by 2.8% year-on-year in the same period. The Gol 
continued to be the most popular Group model in Argentina in 
terms of registrations.  Deliveries in the Asia-Pacific region 
The passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region expanded by 
4.0% in 2015, with declining momentum overall. The Volkswagen 
Group handed over 3,902,169 vehicles to customers there, 3.0% 
fewer than in the previous year. 
China, the world’s largest single market, was again the growth 
driver of the Asia-Pacific region in 2015, recording the highest 
absolute increase. Attractively priced entry-level models in the 
SUV 
segment remained highly sought after. Volkswagen delivered 3.4% 
fewer vehicles to customers in China than in the prior-year period. 
The Jetta, Lavida, Sagitar, Tiguan, Audi Q5,

98  COMMERCIAL VEHICLE DELIVERIES The Volkswagen Group delivered a total of 609,836 commercial 
vehicles to customers worldwide in the reporting period, 5.7% 
fewer than in the previous year. Trucks accounted for 161,901 units 
(–9.9%), and buses accounted for 17,134 units (–15.5%). Sales by 
the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand were down 3.5% on 
the prior-year figure, with 430,801 vehicles delivered in 2015. The 
MAN brand handed over 102,474 vehicles to customers, 14.7% 
fewer than in 2014, while the Scania brand’s deliveries were down 
4.0% year-on-year at 76,561.  
With the economy in Western Europe picking up, the Volks-
wagen Group delivered 2.0% more commercial vehicles than in the 
previous year, a total of 368,603 units; of this figure, 284,600 were 
light commercial vehicles, 79,146 were trucks and 4,857 were 
buses. The Transporter and Caddy models were the most sought-
after models in Western European markets. 
In 2015, we handed over a total of 55,295 commercial vehicles 
to customers (–13.7%) in Central and Eastern Europe, consisting of 
31,183 light commercial vehicles, 23,243 trucks and 869 buses. In 
Russia, the region’s largest market, deliveries to customers declined 
by 56.9% to a total of 9,736 units due to the tense and uncertain 
political situation, the economic downturn, the low oil price, the 
sustained currency weakness and difficult financing conditions in 
the reporting period. The Transporter and the Caddy were the 
Group models that experienced the highest demand in this region. In the Other markets, the Volkswagen Group increased its deliv-
eries by 2.8% to 74,935 commercial vehicles; of this figure, 49,840 
were light commercial vehicles, 22,504 were trucks and 2,591 were 
buses. 
In North America, the Group handed over 9,099 vehicles to 
customers in the reporting period, an increase of 9.2% year-on-
year; of this figure, 6,802 were light commercial vehicles, 474 were 
trucks and 1,823 were buses.  
Deliveries in the South American markets declined overall to 
68,958 units (–34.2%), consisting of 36,961 light commercial 
vehicles, 27,311 trucks and 4,686 buses. The economic slowdown 
and difficult financing conditions in Brazil led to a 51.3% decrease 
in deliveries to customers; 12,218 light commercial vehicles, 
21,327 trucks and 2,968 buses were handed over to customers. 
Once again, the Amarok was particularly popular in Brazil. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, the Volkswagen Group handed over 
32,946 vehicles to customers in the reporting period; 21,415 light 
commercial vehicles, 9,223 trucks and 2,308 buses: a total of 6.1% 
less than in the previous year. The Amarok and the Transporter 
were the most popular Group models. In the Chinese market, the 
Group delivered 6,165 units to customers; of this figure, 3,860 were 
light commercial vehicles, 2,068 were trucks and 237 were buses. 
Overall, this represents a decrease of 10.5% on the prior-year 
figure.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Business Development  
99 DELIVERIES IN THE POWER ENGINEERING SEGMENT Orders in the Power Engineering segment are usually part of major 
investment projects. Lead times typically range from just under one 
year to several years, and partial deliveries as construction pro-
gresses are common. Accordingly, there is a time lag between 
incoming orders and sales revenue from the new construction 
business.  
Sales revenue in the Power Engineering segment was largely 
driven by Engines & Marine Systems and Turbomachinery, which 
together generated three-quarters of the overall revenue volume. In 
2015, the world’s first compressor for an underwater gas produc-
tion facility was put into operation.  
ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE PASSENGER CARS SEGMENT IN WESTERN 
EUROPE  
Due to the positive development of Western European markets, 
demand for passenger cars increased in fiscal year 2015 compared 
to the previous year. This was also reflected in our orders received; 
these were 4.0% higher than in the year before. All key markets in 
the region contributed to this rise. 
 
ORDERS RECEIVED FOR COMMERCIAL VEHICLES 
Demand for the Volkswagen Group’s light commercial vehicles in 
the Western European markets rose year-on-year in 2015. At 
290,771 vehicles, orders received were down 3.6% compared with 
the previous year.  
Incoming orders for mid-sized and heavy trucks and buses 
declined overall in 2015, with orders received for 184,637 vehicles 
(–9.8%). In Western Europe, our main sales market, positive eco-
nomic stimulus gave a boost to incoming orders. In South America, 
however, the deterioration in the economic situation had a negative 
impact on the order intake.  
ORDERS RECEIVED IN THE POWER ENGINEERING SEGMENT 
The long-term performance of the Power Engineering business is 
determined by the macroeconomic environment. Major individual 
orders lead to fluctuations in incoming orders during the year that 
do not correlate with these long-term trends. 
Orders received in the Power Engineering segment in 2015 
amounted to €3.4 billion. Engines & Marine Systems and Turbo-
machinery generated the most new orders, together accounting for 
almost three-quarters of the order volume.  
In addition to the order for twelve self-produced dual-fuel 
engines for the world’s biggest crane vessel, orders were also received 
for an air compressor with the world’s highest flow rate in air 
separation and, in China, for the first mechanical drive turbine of 
the new gas turbine family. In addition, a private power producer in 
Bangladesh ordered six engines with total power output of 111 MW.  
 
 
  VOLKSWAGEN GROUP FINANCIAL SERVICES 
The Financial Services Division combines the Volkswagen Group’s 
dealer and customer financing, leasing, banking and insurance 
activities, fleet management and mobility offerings. The division 
comprises Volkswagen Financial Services (including the financial 
services business of 
MAN Finance International GmbH since Janu-
ary 1, 2014) and the financial services activities of Scania, Porsche 
and Porsche Holding Salzburg. 
The number of new contracts signed worldwide in the Customer 
Financing/Leasing and Service/Insurance areas rose by 3.9% year-
on-year in 2015 to 5.6 million. The total number of contracts was 
14.4 million as of the end of 2015, surpassing the figure at the 
prior-year reporting date by 7.3%. The number of contracts in the 
Customer Financing/Leasing area was up by 6.6% to 8.9 million, 
while the number of contracts in the Service/Insurance area 
increased by 8.6% to 5.5 million. The ratio of leased or financed 
vehicles to Group deliveries (penetration rate) increased to 
31.5 (30.7)% in the Financial Services Division’s markets. 
In Europe/Other markets, 4.0 million new contracts were 
signed in the reporting period, 8.8% more than in the previous 
year. The number of contracts was up 10.0% to 10.3 million as of 
December 31, 2015. This included 5.5 million contracts in the 
Customer Financing/Leasing area, an increase of 7.3% on the 
figure for 2014. At the same time, the share of leased or financed 
vehicles increased from 43.6% to 44.3% of deliveries. 
In North America, the Financial Services Division added 814 
thousand new contracts, up 0.6% year-on-year. The total number 
of contracts stood at 2.1 million (–0.9%). Of this figure, 1.7 million 
were attributable to the Customer Financing/Leasing area, 8.0% 
more than in the previous year. The penetration rate in North 
America rose to 61.8 (56.8)%. 
In South America, 262 thousand new contracts were signed in 
the reporting period (–16.7%). The number of contracts was down 
8.6% year-on-year to 756 thousand contracts as of year-end 2015. 
The majority of these were attributable to the Customer Financing/ 
Leasing area. The penetration rate in South America was 
35.5 (33.1)%. 
In the Asia-Pacific region, 530 thousand new contracts were 
signed during the reporting period, an 11.1% decrease on the 
prior-year figure. The total number of contracts amounted to 
1.2 million (+12.0%), of which 996 thousand were attributable to 
the Customer Financing/Leasing area (+15.5%). The share of 
leased or financed vehicles in the region decreased from 13.1% to 
11.6% of deliveries.

100  SALES TO THE DEALER ORGANIZATION In 2015, the Volkswagen Group’s worldwide unit sales to the dealer 
organization – including the Chinese joint ventures – amounted to 
10,009,605 vehicles, down 2.0% on the prior-year figure. The 
decrease of 2.7% in unit sales outside Germany is primarily 
attributable to weaker demand for Group models in Brazil, China 
and Russia. In Germany, the number of vehicles sold increased by 
2.5%. At 12.8%, the proportion of the Group’s sales accounted for 
by Germany was higher than in the previous year (12.2%). 
The Golf, Passat, Jetta and Polo were our biggest sellers last year. 
Golf, Polo, Sharan, the Audi A3 family, Audi Q5, 
ŠKODA Fabia, 
ŠKODA Octavia, the SEAT Leon family and  SEAT Alhambra saw the 
highest rate of increase in sales. The Porsche Macan and Cayenne 
were also very well received by the market. In China, the 
Volkswagen Tiguan and Polo models as well as the Audi A3, 
ŠKODA 
Octavia and the new Volkswagen Lamando especially developed for 
this market were very popular with customers. 
PRODUCTION 
The Volkswagen Group produced 10,017,191 vehicles worldwide in 
fiscal year 2015, 1.9% fewer than in the previous year. Our Chinese 
joint ventures produced 3.1% fewer units than in the previous year. 
The percentage of the Group’s total production accounted for by 
Germany was higher than in 2014, at 26.8 (25.1)%. In the past year, 
our plants worldwide produced an average of 41,890 vehicles per 
working day (+3.1%). The Volkswagen Group production figures do 
not include the Crafter models built in the Daimler plants. 
 
INVENTORIES 
Global vehicle inventories at Group companies and in the dealer 
organization were higher on December 31, 2015 than at year-end 
2014, mainly due to demand-induced stocking in Western Europe.  
  EMPLOYEES 
Including the Chinese joint ventures, the Volkswagen Group 
employed an average of 604,387 people in fiscal year 2015, an 
increase of 3.6% year-on-year. Our companies in Germany 
employed 275,857 people on average in 2015; at 45.6 (45.5)%, 
their share of the headcount was on a level with the previous year. 
The Volkswagen Group had 585,242 active employees (+3.2%) as of 
the 2015 reporting date. In addition, 6,183 employees were in the 
passive phase of their partial retirement and 18,651 young persons 
were in vocational traineeships (+1.0%). The Volkswagen Group’s 
headcount was 610,076 employees (+3.0%) at the end of the 
reporting period. Significant factors for the increase in employees 
were the expansion of the workforce in our new plants in China, 
Poland and Mexico and the recruitment of specialists, particularly 
in Germany and China. A total of 278,685 people were employed in 
Germany (+2.8%), while 331,391 were employed abroad (+3.1%).

Shares and Bonds  
101 EQUITY MARKETS Prices on the international equity markets experienced volatility in 
the reporting period. The 
DAX rose moderately overall. Capital 
market participants were unsettled in particular by weakened eco-
nomic growth in China.  
The announcement by the European Central Bank (
ECB) at the 
beginning of the first quarter of 2015 of its intention to buy sover-
eign bonds, together with falling oil prices, resulted in significant 
share price gains. The election result in Greece caused only short-
term price falls. Positive economic data from the eurozone, hopes of 
an agreement between the eurozone countries and the Greek 
government, and some easing of the situation in Ukraine led to 
share prices rising further in February. Buoyed up by positive 
signals from the US labor market, good economic data from 
Germany and the 
ECB’s bond purchases, the markets rose further 
at the beginning of March. Towards the end of the first quarter, 
share prices declined slightly as expectations of a more restrictive 
monetary policy from the US Federal Reserve, among other things, 
unsettled capital market participants. 
In the second quarter of 2015, the deteriorating situation in 
Greece and concerns about its effect on the European economy 
were the main triggers for falling prices. Healthy corporate results 
and expectations that the 
ECB would continue its bond-buying 
program and the US Federal Reserve its loose monetary policy 
brought about a temporary recovery in April, propelling the 
DAX to a 
new all-time high of 12,375 points. The 
DAX moved sideways amid 
significant price swings as the second quarter progressed. Investors’ 
hopes of a more expansionary monetary policy by the Chinese 
central bank and healthy labor market data from the 
USA supported  prices, while concerns over the situation in Greece led to uncer-
tainty. Prices declined towards the end of the second quarter amid 
volatility brought about by increasing fears of sovereign insolvency 
in Greece and growing uncertainty about whether it would remain 
in the eurozone.  
In the third quarter, the agreement on a further rescue package 
for Greece and the resulting prevention of sovereign insolvency 
shored up prices in an environment dominated by considerable 
price falls on the Chinese stock markets. As the third quarter pro-
gressed, uncertainty regarding the slower growth of the Chinese 
economy notably contributed to a decline in prices. Prices stabilized 
temporarily towards the end of the third quarter, based on hopes of 
a key interest rate cut by China’s central bank and positive macro 
data from Europe, before declining once again at the end of 
September because of concerns regarding the slight slowdown in 
global economic growth.  
Following the price falls towards the end of the third quarter, 
hopes that the  ECB would expand its bond-buying program and the 
Chinese central bank would lower key interest rates initially drove 
prices higher in the last quarter. In the last few trading weeks of 
2015, however, stock prices
 gave up some of their gains as negative 
economic data from China and the decline in the oil price unsettled 
capital market participants. The US Federal Reserve’s interest rate 
hike towards the end of the fourth quarter met with a positive 
response on the European stock exchanges. 
At the end of 2015, the 
DAX had reached 10,743 points, up 9.6% 
on the previous year’s figure. The 
EURO STOXX Automobiles & Parts 
closed the year at 542 points, 13.3% higher than on the last day of 
trading in 2014.

MOVEMENTS IN THE PRICE OF VOLKSWAGEN’S SHARES 
On the whole, Volkswagen AG’s ordinary and preferred shares 
declined sharply in 2015, underperforming the overall market and 
the automotive sector.  
In the first quarter, both classes of shares clearly outperformed 
the upward trend on the equity markets. The above-average 
increase at the beginning of 2015 was driven by several factors: 
firstly the strong results we presented when the Company’s annual 
financial statements for the fiscal year 2014 were published, but 
above all the positive conditions on the capital markets and the 
depreciation of the euro against other currencies, which is advan-
tageous for export industries.  
In the second quarter, Volkswagen shares gave up some of their 
gains made during the first three months. With stock markets in 
decline, discussions about the composition of the Board of Manage-
ment and the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG, as well as 
increasing concerns about slower growth in demand for passenger 
cars due to China’s weaker economy influenced market partici-
pants. As the quarter progressed, both classes of shares were more 
volatile than the market as a whole, trailing market growth. 
In the course of the third quarter, ordinary and preferred 
shares progressively continued their downward trend, thus lagging 
significantly behind the market trend. Investors focusing on the 
automotive industry were unsettled by weaker economic growth in 
China, among other factors. After the emergence of irregularities in the software used in certain diesel engines and the resulting 
public speculations concerning possible expected consequences, 
both classes of shares fell considerably in mid-September 2015.  
After reaching the lowest closing price for the year at the 
beginning of the fourth quarter, Volkswagen shares recovered 
temporarily from their sharp declines. As a result of the news that, 
as part of the internal examination of all diesel engines, we also 
encountered evidence that irregularities in the determination of 
the CO
2 figures for vehicles’ type approvals in the EU28 countries 
could initially not be ruled out, the prices of both classes of shares 
trended lower again. 
As the fourth quarter progressed, the information about 
technical solutions for our customers in the EU28 countries to 
rectify the irregularities in NO
x emissions, and the clarification of 
the CO
2 issue led to a rise in the share price amid significant 
fluctuations. The prices of Volkswagen shares moved sideways 
towards the end of the fourth quarter.

  DIVIDEND POLICY 
Our dividend policy matches our financial strategy. In the interests 
of all stakeholders, we aim for continuous dividend growth so that 
our shareholders can participate appropriately in our business 
success. The proposed dividend amount therefore reflects our 
financial management objectives – in particular, ensuring a solid 
financial foundation as part of the implementation of our strategy. 
The Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Volks-
wagen AG are proposing a dividend of €0.11 per ordinary share and 
€0.17 per preferred share. On this basis, the total dividend for 
fiscal year 2015 amounts to €0.1 (2.3) billion. The distribution ratio 
is based on the Group’s earnings after tax attributable to Volks-
wagen AG shareholders and was negative for the reporting period. 
In the previous year the distribution ratio amounted to 21.2%. We 
aim to achieve a distribution ratio of 30% in the medium term.  
DIVIDEND YIELD 
Based on the dividend proposal for the reporting period, the 
dividend yield on Volkswagen ordinary shares is 0.1 (2.7)%, 
measured by the closing price on the last trading day in 2015. The 
dividend yield on preferred shares is 0.1 (2.6)%. 
The current dividend proposal can be found in the chapter 
entitled “Volkswagen AG (condensed, according to the German 
Commercial Code)”, on page 127 of this annual report. 
SUCCESSFUL HYBRID NOTE PLACEMENT AND MANDATORY 
CONVERTIBLE NOTE SETTLEMENT 
In March 2015, the Volkswagen Group successfully placed dual-
tranche hybrid notes with an aggregate principal amount of 
€2.5 million via Volkswagen International Finance N.V. Both 
tranches are perpetual and increase the Group’s equity by 100%, 
net of transaction costs. 
In 2012 and 2013, we placed two mandatory convertible notes 
with identical features entitling holders to subscribe for Volks-
wagen preferred shares totaling €3.7 billion. Mandatory conver-
sion took place for the holders of the notes on the final maturity 
date (November 9, 2015). A total of 25.6 million new preferred 
shares were created during the term.

datory convertible notes had to be included in full in the calculation 
of earnings per share for fiscal year 2015.  
The year-on-year comparison has to take into account that, in 
accordance with 
IAS 33.23, all potential shares that may be issued 
upon the conversion of mandatory convertible notes must be 
accounted for as issued shares and therefore had to be included in 
the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. In accor-
dance with 
IAS 33.26, the number of potential preferred shares 
included in the previous year had to be replaced retrospectively 
with the actual number of shares created as a result of voluntary 
and mandatory conversion in the reporting period. In addition, the 
new preferred shares from the capital increase have been included 
in the calculation since their admission to the regulated market on 
June 12, 2014. Since the number of basic and diluted shares is 
identical, basic earnings per share correspond to diluted earnings 
per share.  
See also note 11 to the Volkswagen consolidated financial state-
ments for the calculation of earnings per share. 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 
The 55th Annual General Meeting of Volkswagen AG was held at the 
Hanover Exhibition Center on May 5, 2015. With 91.93% of the 
voting capital present, the ordinary shareholders of Volkswagen AG 
formally approved the actions of the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board and the conclusion of an intercompany agree-
ment. They also elected PricewaterhouseCoopers AG Wirtschafts-
prüfungsgesellschaft as the auditors for the single-entity and 
consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2015 and as the 
auditors to review the condensed consolidated financial statements 
and interim management report for the first six months of 2015.  
Mr. Hussain Ali Al-Abdulla’s scheduled term of office on the 
Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG expired at the end of the 
Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting elected Mr. 
Al-Abdulla to the Supervisory Board for a further full term of office 
as a shareholder representative. Mr. Ahmad Al-Sayed, likewise a 
shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board of Volks-
wagen AG, stepped down from his post as of the end of the Annual 
General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting elected Mr. Akbar 
Al Baker, Minister of State and Group Chief Executive of Qatar 
Airways, to replace him for the remainder of his term of office. In 
addition, the ordinary shareholders authorized the Board of 
Management to issue a total of up to 70 million new non-voting 
preferred bearer shares within the next five years.  The Annual General Meeting also resolved to distribute a dividend 
of €4.80 per ordinary share and €4.86 per preferred share for fiscal 
year 2014. 
  INVESTOR RELATIONS ACTIVITIES 
In fiscal year 2015, the Investor Relations team provided extensive 
information to investors and analysts in all key financial markets 
worldwide about the strategic focus, current business performance 
and future prospects of the Volkswagen Group.  
At the beginning of the year, the Group 
CFO and the CFO of 
AUDI AG attended investor conferences in Detroit and Frankfurt, 
where they provided information about general market forecasts, 
product innovations, the strategy and the Group-wide efficiency 
program. At the Annual Media and Investor Conference held in 
Berlin on March 12, 2015, the Group’s Board of Management 
looked back on a successful fiscal year in 2014 and answered 
questions from media representatives, analysts and investors. At 
the International Motor Show (
IAA) in Frankfurt am Main, the 
Group presented its models of the future; in addition, we informed 
investors about the Company’s strategy at an investor conference. 
In the last quarter of the year, our investor relations work was 
dominated by the investigations and measures to clarify the diesel 
and CO
2 issue as well as the associated personnel changes on the 
Board of Management. This included a dialogue with members of 
the Group’s Board of Management and senior executives, who, 
after a press conference on the emissions issue, informed investors 
about the package of measures intended and the current status of 
the investigations, among other things.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Shares and Bonds  
106    
 
At roughly 850 one-on-one discussions, roadshows and confer-
ences, we maintained close contact with capital market participants 
in 2015. Many of these discussions involved an exchange of ideas 
between investors and analysts and members of the Board of 
Management and Group senior executives. With offices in Wolfs-
burg, London and Beijing and the liaison office in Herndon (
USA), 
the investor relations team’s work benefits from its presence in the 
most important regions for the capital markets. It allows us to keep 
close contact with analysts and investors locally, acquire in-depth 
knowledge of the respective markets and keep a finger on the pulse 
of operations of the Volkswagen Group.  
At events held in the past year, the investor relations team also 
informed private shareholders about the current situation of the 
Group. It had its own stand at the Annual General Meeting in 
Hanover.  
The Internet continues to enjoy high priority in our capital 
market communication. It is the first source of information for 
many of our investors and analysts as well as interested members of 
the public, offering ways of getting in touch with the Company, 
while we use it to provide them with the latest news, important facts 
and publications. The Annual Media and Investor Conference held 
in March, the Annual General Meeting in May and the conference 
calls of the Volkswagen Group on the quarterly results were again 
broadcast live on the Internet in 2015. 
We also promptly published all presentations given in connec-
tion with events that were of interest to investors on our investor 
relations website.  REFINANCING  
In the refinancing activities conducted in 2015, the Volkswagen 
Group continued to attach great importance to instrument and 
market diversification. The main currencies of its prime-rated and 
unsecured issues were euros, US dollars, sterling and Canadian 
dollars; the share of fixed-rate instruments was roughly twice as 
high as the share of variable-rate instruments.  
The need for financing was reduced as a result of the generally 
positive development of net liquidity in fiscal year 2015. In addition 
to the operating business, the sale of the shares in Suzuki was a 
contributing factor.  
Moreover, net liquidity was boosted in March 2015 by placing 
unsecured subordinated hybrid notes with an aggregate principal 
amount of €2.5 billion. The perpetual notes were issued in two 
tranches and can only be called by the issuer. The first call date for 
the first tranche with a volume of €1.1 billion is after seven years, 
and the first call date for the second tranche of €1.4 billion is after 
15 years.  
In the European region, a benchmark bond with a value of €3.0 
billion was successfully issued for the Automotive Division. We also 
acted in this market for the Financial Services Division, issuing two 
benchmark bonds with a total value of €2.75 billion and raising 
another €7.7 billion through 
ABS (asset-backed securities) 
transactions. The financing mix was complemented by private 
placements, making use of available interest rate and currency 
opportunities.  REFINANCING STRUCTURE OF THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Shares and Bonds  
107 The Volkswagen Group was also active again in the North American 
capital market and was able to exploit the favorable pricing 
situation to its advantage. A four-tranche issue with an aggregate 
volume of 
USD 2.8 billion was placed and another  USD 3.8  billion 
was securitized in ABS transactions. In the Canadian refinancing 
market, we issued bonds with a value of 
CAD 900 million in an 
attractive market environment.  
The Volkswagen Group placed other securities in the ABS seg-
ment in Australia, Brazil, China, the United Kingdom, Japan and 
Canada.  
In all refinancing arrangements, interest rate and currency risk 
is generally excluded by entering into derivatives contracts at the 
same time.  
The table below shows how our money and capital market 
programs were utilized as of December 31, 2015 and illustrates the 
financial flexibility of the Volkswagen Group:

 The ability to access individual refinancing instruments in the 
money and capital market was limited due to the current uncer-
tainties regarding the effects of the emissions issue on the Volks-
wagen Group.  
In December 2015, a consortium of banks granted Volkswagen 
AG an additional syndicated credit line amounting to €20 billion 
with a maturity of one year. After exercising an extension option in 
the reporting period, the syndicated credit line of €5.0 billion 
agreed in July 2011 was extended to April 2020. The credit line 
remains unused.  
Syndicated credit lines worth a total of €3.1 billion at other 
Group companies have also not been drawn down. In addition, 
Group companies had arranged bilateral, confirmed credit lines 
with national and international banks in various other countries for 
a total of €7.3 billion, of which €2.6 billion was drawn down.

RATINGS 
In March 2015, rating agency Moody’s Investors Service raised its 
short-term and long-term ratings for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH by one notch 
each from P-2 to P-1 and from A3 to A2 respectively. The primary 
reasons for this were the solid operating performance in 2014 and 
the expectation that this can be improved on over the next 12 to 18 
months due to the robust brand portfolio, the market position in 
Western Europe and China, and the continuing efforts to increase 
efficiency.  
In June 2015, Moody’s Investors Service raised the long-term 
rating of both Volkswagen Financial Services AG and Volkswagen 
Bank GmbH by two notches each to Aa3. The reason for this was a 
change in the rating method. 
As a result of the emissions issue, Moody’s Investors Service 
lowered its short-term and long-term ratings for Volkswagen AG in 
November 2015 by one notch each from P–1 to P–2 and from A2 to 
A3 respectively. The long-term ratings for Volkswagen Financial 
Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH were downgraded from 
Aa3 to A1. The rating agency lowered the outlook for the companies 
from stable to negative.  
In connection with the irregularities in the software used for 
certain diesel engines from the Volkswagen Group, in October 2015 
Standard & Poor’s initially downgraded the short-term and long-
term ratings for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Financial Services AG 
and Volkswagen Bank GmbH by one notch each, to A–2 and A– 
respectively.  
In a further step in December 2015, also as a result of the emis-
sions issue, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the long-term ratings 
for Volkswagen AG and Volkswagen Financial Services AG from A– 
to 
BBB+. The outlook for Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen Financial Ser-
vices AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH has been changed to negative.   VOLKSWAGEN IN SUSTAINABILITY RANKINGS AND INDICES  
Analysts and investors view corporate social responsibility  (CSR) 
and sustainability performance as leading indicators of forward-
looking corporate governance and therefore increasingly also base 
their recommendations and decisions on companies’ 
CSR and 
sustainability profiles. Sustainability ratings are particularly well 
suited to evaluating a company’s environmental, social and eco-
nomic performance. If a company achieves the highest scores in 
these ratings, this sends a clear signal to its stakeholders; it also 
raises its attractiveness as an employer and the motivation of its 
existing employees.  
In sustainability rankings and indices – such as the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Indices, 
CDP Carbon Disclosure Project, Sustain-
alytics, or oekom research – where we held top positions before the 
emissions issue, Volkswagen’s ratings have been downgraded or 
removed.  
In the Commercial Vehicles/Power Engineering Business Area, 
MAN retained its B– rating and prime status for its superior per-
formance in the area of corporate social responsibility awarded by 
the rating agency oekom research.  
In its annual review of its sustainability ranking, the Swiss 
rating agency Robeco
SAM selected MAN for listing in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index (
DJSI) World and the  DJSI Europe in the 
“Machinery and Electrical Equipment” sector. 
MAN is the only Ger-
man company to be represented in both indices for the fourth 
consecutive year.

Results of Operations, Financial Position and Net Assets  
 
109 
The Volkswagen Group’s segment reporting in compliance with 
IFRS 8 comprises the four reportable segments Passenger Cars, 
Commercial Vehicles, Power Engineering and Financial Services, 
in line with the Group’s internal management and reporting. 
At Volkswagen, segment profit or loss is measured on the basis 
of the operating result. 
The reconciliation column contains activities and other 
operations that do not by definition constitute segments. These 
include the unallocated Group financing activities. Consolidation 
adjustments between the segments (including the holding company 
functions) are also contained in the reconciliation. Purchase price 
allocation for Porsche Holding Salzburg and Porsche, as well as for 
Scania and 
MAN, reflects their accounting treatment in the 
segments. 
The Automotive Division comprises the Passenger Cars, Com-
mercial Vehicles and Power Engineering segments, as well as the 
figures from the reconciliation. The Passenger Cars segment and 
the reconciliation are combined to form the Passenger Cars 
Business Area. We report on the Commercial Vehicles and Power Engineering segments under the Commercial Vehicles/Power 
Engineering Business Area. The Financial Services Division 
corresponds to the Financial Services segment. 
Activities in the Passenger Cars segment cover the development 
of vehicles and engines, the production and sale of passenger cars, 
and the genuine parts business. This segment combines the 
Volkswagen Group’s individual passenger car brands on a consoli-
dated basis. It also includes the Ducati brand’s motorcycle business. 
The Commercial Vehicles segment primarily comprises the 
development, production and sale of light commercial vehicles, 
trucks and buses from the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, 
Scania and  MAN brands, the corresponding genuine parts business 
and related services.  
The Power Engineering segment combines the large-bore 
diesel engines, turbomachinery, special gear units, propulsion 
components and testing systems businesses. 
The activities of the Financial Services segment comprise 
dealer and customer financing, leasing, banking and insurance 
activities, fleet management and mobility offerings.

Position and Net Assets 
The Volkswagen Group’s operating result was down considerably year-on-year in 2015 due to charges 
in connection with the emissions issue, and restructuring measures in the trucks business and in the 
passenger cars area in South America. Sales revenue increased. ",,,,,,,,,,
141,"  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Results of Operations, Financial Position and Net Assets  
 
110  SPECIAL ITEMS IN THE FISCAL YEAR 
On September 18, 2015, US authorities publicly announced that 
irregularities had been discovered in the software used for certain 
Volkswagen Group diesel engines. In a statement issued on Sep-
tember 22, 2015, the Volkswagen Group announced that there are 
irregularities in around 11 million vehicles worldwide with type  
EA 189 diesel engines. In fiscal year 2015, this resulted in 
exceptional charges, in particular for the technical measures 
planned for the diesel engines affected, repurchases, customer-
related measures and legal risks. The negative special items 
relating to the diesel issue amounted to €16.2 billion and were 
recognized in the operating result.  
The operating result was also impacted by special items relating 
to restructuring expenses in the trucks business (€0.2 billion) and 
in the passenger cars area in South America (€0.2 billion). The 
restructuring measures serve to sustainably enhance competitive-
ness. 
Additionally, the competent authorities directed all automobile 
manufacturers affected to replace potentially faulty airbags manu-
factured and supplied by Takata, resulting in a requirement to 
recognize provisions. The recall and replacement of the airbags is 
limited to the USA and Canada. 0.9 million Volkswagen Group 
vehicles are affected. The special items recognized in the operating 
result relating to these measures amount to €–0.3 billion. Overall, negative special items recognized in the operating result 
therefore amounted to €16.9 billion in fiscal year 2015. 
 
SALE OF SUZUKI SHARES  
In August 2015, the arbitration ruling in the proceedings between 
Suzuki Motor Corporation and Volkswagen AG was delivered to the 
parties. Volkswagen subsequently sold its 19.9% equity investment 
in Suzuki to Suzuki on September 17, 2015 at the quoted market 
price of €3.1 billion. The sale of the shares generated income in the 
amount of €1.5 billion, which was recognized in the other financial 
result.  
 
SETTLEMENT PAYMENT TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST 
SHAREHOLDERS OF MAN SE 
In the award proceedings regarding the appropriateness of the cash 
settlement to be paid to the noncontrolling interest shareholders of 
MAN SE, the Munich Regional Court ruled in the first instance at 
the end of July 2015 that the settlement payment to be made to the 
shareholders should be increased from €80.89 to €90.29 per share. 
Both Volkswagen and a number of noncontrolling interest share-
holders have appealed to the Higher Regional Court in Munich. 
Remeasurement of the put options and compensation rights 
resulted in an expense of €0.4 billion, which was recognized in the 
other financial result.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
Results of operations of the Group 
The Volkswagen Group generated sales revenue of €213.3 billion in 
fiscal year 2015, 5.4% higher than in the previous year. The 
increase was mainly attributable to improvements in the mix, 
positive exchange rate effects and the positive business develop-
ment in the Financial Services Division. The Group generated 
80.2 (80.6)% of its sales revenue outside Germany. 
At €33.9 (36.5) billion, gross profit was below the level of the 
previous year. The cost of sales rose by 8.1%, primarily as a result of 
the charges in connection with the diesel issue. In addition, higher 
depreciation and amortization charges as a result of the high 
volume of capital expenditures and higher upfront expenditures – 
especially for new drive concepts – had a negative effect, while 
optimized product costs had a positive effect. The gross margin was 
15.9 (18.0)%; excluding special items it was 19.9%. 
Distribution expenses rose by 15.9% in the year under review 
due to the diesel issue and exchange rate changes; the ratio of 
distribution expenses to sales revenue also increased. Adminis-
trative expenses were up 5.2% on the previous year, although the 
ratio of administrative expenses to sales revenue remained 
unchanged. The other operating result declined by €10.6 billion to  
€–
 7.3 billion, mainly as a result of negative exchange rate effects, 
legal risks in connection with the emissions issue and restructuring 
measures in the trucks business and in the passenger cars business 
area in South America.   
 
Excluding the special items, the Volkswagen Group’s operating 
result in fiscal year 2015 was on a level with the previous year, at 
€12.8 billion. Lower vehicle volumes, higher depreciation and 
amortization charges, and higher research and development 
expenditures were offset in part by optimized product costs, 
improvements in the mix and more favorable exchange rates. The 
operating return on sales before special items was 6.0 (6.3)%. 
Negative special items totaled €16.9 billion. As a result, the 
operating result declined sharply to €–  4.1 (12.7) billion;  the 
operating return on sales decreased to –
 1.9 (6.3%).  
The Volkswagen Group’s earnings before tax amounted to  
€–
 1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015, €16.1 billion lower than in the 
previous year. The return on sales before tax fell from 7.3% to  
–
 0.6%. The income tax expense amounted to €0.1 (3.7) billion. 
Earnings after tax were down €12.4 billion on the prior-year figure, 
at €–
 1.4 billion.  
Results of operations in the Automotive Division 
The Automotive Division’s sales revenue rose year-on-year to 
€183.9 (177.5) billion in the reporting period. The increase was 
primarily due to positive mix effects and the exchange rate trend, 
which was partly offset by a decline in vehicle unit sales. As our 
Chinese joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, 
the Group’s business growth in the Chinese passenger car market is 
mainly reflected in consolidated sales revenue only by deliveries of 
vehicles and vehicle parts.

112  Cost of sales was negatively impacted by increased depreciation 
charges as a result of high capital expenditures, increased research 
and development expenditures – particularly for new drive concepts 
– and exchange rate effects. Other items recognized here com-
prised the charges for technical measures and repurchases in 
connection with the diesel issue. Improved product costs had a 
positive effect. The ratio of cost of sales to sales revenue rose year-
on-year. At €28.4 (31.2) billion, gross profit in the Automotive 
Division was below the previous year. 
Distribution expenses in the reporting period were 16.1% 
higher than in the previous year as a result of the emissions issue 
and exchange rate effects. The ratio of distribution expenses to sales 
revenue also increased. Administrative expenses rose by 4.0% due 
among other things to exchange rate effects, although the ratio of 
administrative expenses to sales revenue remained unchanged. 
The other operating result declined by €10.9 billion to €–
 6.8 billion. 
The change is largely attributable to negative exchange rate effects, 
the special items resulting from legal risks in connection with the 
diesel issue and the restructuring expenses in the trucks business 
and in the passenger cars business area in South America.  
The Automotive Division generated an operating result of  
€–
 6.3 billion in fiscal year 2015, down €17.1 billion on the previous 
year due in particular to the special items. The operating return on 
sales fell to –
 3.4 (6.1)%. The operating result before special items 
was €10.6 (10.8) billion. Declining vehicle volumes, higher depre-
ciation and amortization charges as a result of the high volume of 
capital expenditures, higher upfront expenditures – especially for 
new drive concepts – and market support measures linked to the 
emissions issue weighed on the operating result. It was positively 
impacted by optimized product costs, improvements in the mix and 
more favorable exchange rates. Since the profit recorded by the 
joint venture companies is accounted for in the financial result 
using the equity method, the business growth of our Chinese joint 
ventures is mainly reflected in the Group’s operating result only by 
deliveries of vehicles and vehicle parts as well as license revenue.  
The financial result improved by €0.6 billion to €2.7 billion. 
The increase was due to the disposal gain on the shares in Suzuki, 
income from the Chinese joint ventures, which was up on the prior-
year figures, as a result of exchange rate effects as well as lower 
overall finance costs. Higher expenses from the measurement of 
derivative financial instruments at the reporting date and negative 
remeasurement effects relating to the put options and compen-
sation rights in the context of the control and profit and loss transfer 
agreement with 
MAN SE had an offsetting effect.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PASSENGER CARS BUSINESS AREA

operating result decreased to €0.7 (0.9) billion, while the operating 
return on sales declined from 2.8% to 2.1%. The reasons for this 
decline were the difficult environment in Brazil and Russia, 
together with the related decrease in volumes, as well as the 
restructuring measures in the trucks business, which could not be 
offset by positive exchange rate effects and the expansion of the 
service business. At €123 (44) million, the operating result in the 
Power Engineering segment exceeded the prior-year figure.

113 Results of operations in the Financial Services Division 
The Financial Services Division generated sales revenue of 
€29.4 billion in fiscal year 2015. The 17.8% year-on-year increase 
was attributable to higher business volumes and positive exchange 
rate effects.  
At €5.5 billion, gross profit was 4.4% higher than in the pre-
vious year despite sustained pressure on margins and higher 
depreciation and amortization charges. 
Because of the higher volumes and in particular the need to 
comply with continued increase in regulatory requirements, distri-
bution and administrative expenses increased in the year under 
review, although the ratios of both to sales revenue declined slightly. 
Other operating result amounted to €–
 0.5 (– 0.9) billion.  
The operating result at the Financial Services Division rose by 
16.6% year-on-year to €2.2 billion, again making a significant 
contribution to the Group’s result. The operating return on sales 
declined to 7.6 (7.7)%. At 12.2 (12.5)%, the return on equity was 
down on the prior-year figure. 
PRINCIPLES AND GOALS OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
Financial management at the Volkswagen Group covers liquidity 
management, currency, interest rate and commodity risk manage-
ment, as well as credit and country risk management. It is performed 
centrally for all Group companies by Group Treasury, based on 
internal directives and risk parameters. The MAN and Porsche 
Holding Salzburg subgroups are integrated into the main financial 
management functions, while Scania is integrated to a very limited 
extent. Additionally, these subgroups have their own well-estab-
lished financial management structures.  
The goal of liquidity management is to ensure that the Volks-
wagen Group remains solvent at all times and at the same time to 
generate an adequate return from the investment of surplus funds. 
We use cash pooling to optimize the use of existing liquidity between 
the significant companies in Europe. To do this, the – positive or 
negative – balances accumulating on the cash pooling accounts are 
swept daily into a target account at Group Treasury and thus pooled. 
Currency, interest rate and commodity risk management is 
designed to hedge the prices on which investment, production and 
sales plans are based using derivative financial instruments. Credit 
  and country risk management aims to use diversification to avoid 
exposing the Volkswagen Group to the risk of loss or default. To 
achieve this, internal limits are defined on the basis of various 
credit risks for the volume of business per counterparty when 
entering into financial transactions. These primarily focus on the 
capital resources of potential counterparties, as well as the ratings 
awarded by independent agencies. The relevant risk limits and the 
authorized financial instruments, hedging methods and hedging 
horizons are approved by the Executive Committee for Liquidity 
and Foreign Currency.  
For additional information on the principles and goals of 
financial management, please refer to page 185 and to the notes to 
the 2015 consolidated financial statements on pages 278 to 286.   FINANCIAL POSITION 
 
Financial position of the Group 
The Volkswagen Group generated gross cash flow of €16.3 billion in 
fiscal year 2015, representing a 38.7% decline year-on-year. Funds 
tied up in working capital amounted to €2.6 billion, down 
€13.2 billion on the previous year. The special items had a negative 
impact on gross cash flow and a positive effect on the change in 
working capital. Cash flows from operating activities were up by 
€2.9 billion year-on-year and amounted to €13.7 billion. 
At €15.5 (16.5) billion, the Volkswagen Group’s investing 
activities attributable to operating activities were down year-on-year, 
mainly due to the sale of the Suzuki shares. Within this item, 
investments in property, plant and equipment, investment property 
and intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs 
(capex) increased from €12.0 billion to €13.2 billion, and capital-
ized development costs also rose by €0.4 billion to €5.0 billion. Net 
cash flow amounted to €–
 1.8 (5.7) billion.  
Cash inflows from financing activities amounted to €9.1 
(4.6) billion. This figure includes the dual-tranche hybrid notes 
successfully placed in March 2015, which was largely offset by 
dividend payments. In the previous year, the figure included the 
increase in the interest in Scania, a capital increase and the 
issuance of hybrid notes.  
The Group’s net liquidity amounted to €–
 100.5 billion  on 
December 31, 2015, compared with €–
 96.5 billion as of year-end 
2014.

Financial position in the Automotive Division 
In fiscal year 2015, the Automotive Division generated gross cash 
flow of €7.5 billion; the decline of €12.6 billion compared with the 
2014 figure was primarily due to the special items, which were 
partly offset by the positive change in the quality of earnings and 
higher dividend payments by the Chinese joint ventures. The 
change in working capital of €16.3 (1.4) billion  resulted  primarily 
from the impact of the special items, which have not yet been 
reflected in cash flow. Cash flows from operating activities 
increased by €2.2 billion to €23.8 billion.  
At €14.9 (15.5) billion, investing activities attributable to 
operating activities in the year under review were down year-on-
year. Capex rose to €12.7 (11.5) billion, producing a capex ratio of 
6.9 (6.5)%. We invested mainly in our production facilities and in 
models that we launched in 2015 or are planning to launch in 2016. 
These are primarily vehicles in the Tiguan, Passat, Touran, Audi A4, 
Audi Q7, Audi Q5 and Audi A8 series, as well as the Porsche 
Panamera and the Bentley Bentayga. Other investment priorities 
were the ecological focus of our model range, the growing use of  
 electric drives and our modular toolkits. Capitalized development 
costs rose to €5.0 (4.6) billion. Investing activities in 2015 included 
a cash inflow of €3.1 billion from the sale of the Suzuki shares. The 
prior-year figure included the intragroup sale of 
MAN Finance 
International GmbH.  
The Automotive Division’s net cash flow improved by €2.8 bil-
lion to €8.9 billion. 
In financing activities, the capital increases carried out by 
Volkswagen AG at Volkswagen Financial Services AG in fiscal year 
2015 in order to finance the growth in business volumes and 
comply with the increase in regulatory capital requirements 
resulted in outflows of €2.3 billion. In May, a total dividend of 
€2.3 billion, €0.4 billion higher than in the previous year, was 
distributed to Volkswagen AG shareholders. Conversely, the suc-
cessful placement of dual-tranche hybrid notes with an aggregate 
principal amount of €2.5 billion via Volkswagen International 
Finance N.V. in March resulted in a cash inflow. These consist of a 
€1.1 billion note that carries a coupon of 2.5% and has a first call 
date after seven years, and a €1.4 billion note that carries a coupon

generated gross cash flow of €2.8 billion in the reporting period, up 
€0.6 billion on the previous year despite the special items from 
restructuring expenses. €0.8 billion was released from working 
capital in the reporting period, after funds of €1.3 billion were tied 
up in the previous year. As a result, cash flows from operating 
activities rose to €3.6 (0.9) billion. Investing activities attributable to 
operating activities increased year-on-year to €2.5 (1.5) billion. The 
increase was due in particular to capital expenditures on the new 
plant in Wrzesnia, Poland, and on the successor to the Volkswagen 
Crafter that will be built there in the future. Net cash flow rose by 
€1.7 billion to €1.1 billion in the reporting period. 
 
Financial position in the Financial Services Division 
The Financial Services Division’s gross cash flow rose by 37.3% 
year-on-year to €8.8 billion in the fiscal year due to an improvement 
in earnings quality. Funds tied up in working capital increased by 
€1.7 billion to €18.9 billion as a result of higher volumes. At €0.6 
(1.0) billion, investing activities attributable to operating activities 
were significantly lower than in the previous year, when the figure 
reflected the intragroup acquisition of 
MAN Finance International 
GmbH. Volkswagen AG contributed a capital increase of €2.3 billion 
to the Financial Services Division’s financing activities to finance 
the expected growth in business in existing and new markets as well 
as to comply with the continued increase in regulatory require-
ments. Cash inflows to financing activities amounted to €15.4 
(12.6) billion overall.  
The Financial Services Division’s negative net liquidity, which 
is common in the industry, amounted to €–
 125.1 billion at the end 
of the reporting period, compared with €–
 114.1 billion on Decem-
ber 31, 2014. ",,,,,,,,,,

NET ASSETS 
 
Consolidated balance sheet structure 
At €381.9 billion, the Volkswagen Group’s total assets as of Decem-
ber 31, 2015 exceeded the prior-year figure by 8.7%, due among 
other things to the increased business volume of the Financial 
Services Division and to currency factors. The structure of the 
consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting date can be seen 
from the chart above on this page. The Volkswagen Group’s equity 
amounted to €88.3 (90.2) billion at the end of fiscal year 2015. The 
equity ratio decreased to 23.1 (25.7)%.  
As of December 31, 2015, the Group had off-balance-sheet com-
mitments in the form of contingent liabilities in the amount of €3.5 
(3.1) billion, financial guarantees in the amount of €1.6 (1.4) billion 
and other financial obligations in the amount of €25.4 (27.3) billion. 
The latter primarily result from purchase commitments for 
property, plant and equipment, as well as obligations under long-
term leasing and rental contracts and irrevocable credit commit-
ments to customers. Furthermore, negotiations regarding the 
diesel issue are currently being conducted with the authorities in 
the USA concerning possible investments in environmental 
projects and e-mobility. The investments are expected to amount to 
approximately €1.8 billion. Their content and timing have yet to be 
defined. 
 
Automotive Division balance sheet structure 
The Automotive Division’s intangible assets and in particular its 
property, plant and equipment, which reflect the high volume of 
capital expenditures, were up on the year-end 2014 figures as of 
December 31, 2015. While equity-accounted investments rose 
mainly as a result of the acquisition of the shares in 
HERE, a tech-
nology provider for maps and location services, other equity 
investments declined due to the sale of the shares in Suzuki. 
Noncurrent assets rose by a total of 3.6%.  Overall, current assets increased by 7.0% year-on-year; within this 
item, inventories rose by 11.0% due to production-related and 
exchange rate factors. Marketable securities amounted to €12.3 
(9.2) billion and cash and cash equivalents declined by €0.8 billion 
to €15.7 billion.  
The Automotive Division’s equity amounted to €67.4 billion at 
the end of 2015, down 7.5% on the December 31, 2014 figure. It 
was positively affected by healthy earnings growth before special 
items, the hybrid notes issued in March and lower actuarial losses 
from the measurement of pension provisions. Charges resulting 
from the special items, amounts recognized in other 
comprehensive income due to the measurement of derivatives and 
the dividend payment to Volkswagen AG shareholders had an 
offsetting effect. The capital increases implemented in the Financial 
Services Division also reduced equity in the Automotive Division, 
where the deduction was recognized. The noncontrolling interests 
are mainly attributable to  RENK AG and AUDI AG. Since these were 
lower overall than the noncontrolling interests attributable to the 
Financial Services Division, the figure for the Automotive Division, 
where the deduction was recognized, was negative. The division’s 
equity ratio decreased to 32.6 (36.9)%.  
Noncurrent liabilities increased year-on-year to €73.6 (66.4) bil-
lion. Within this item, other liabilities were higher due to negative 
effects from the measurement of derivatives, while other provisions 
rose as a result of the special items. In contrast, pension provisions 
decreased following the change in the discount rate.

119 Current liabilities totaled €65.9 billion, up 13.3% on the year-end 
2014 figure. Other liabilities increased due to the measurement of 
derivatives, and other provisions rose as a result of the special items. 
Reclassifications from noncurrent to current liabilities, in partic-
ular due to shorter remaining maturities, led to an increase in 
current financial liabilities. The figures for the Automotive Division 
also contain the elimination of intragroup transactions between the 
Automotive and Financial Services divisions. As the current finan-
cial liabilities for the primary Automotive Division were lower than 
the loans granted to the Financial Services division, a negative 
amount was disclosed for the reporting period. The item “Put 
options and compensation rights granted to noncontrolling interest 
shareholders” primarily comprises the liability for the obligation to 
acquire the shares held by the remaining free float shareholders of 
MAN. The item was adjusted to €3.9 (3.7) billion, mainly due to the 
increase in the cash settlement payment from the first instance of 
the award proceedings.  
The Automotive Division’s total assets amounted to €206.8 bil-
lion as of December 31, 2015, up 4.8% on the year-end 2014 figure.

At year-end 2015, noncurrent assets in the Passenger Cars Business 
Area were up 3.5% on the prior-year figure at €105.0 billion. 
Property, plant and equipment increased as a result of the com-
prehensive investment program, and equity-accounted investments 
rose primarily because of the acquisition of the shares in HERE. 
Current assets rose by 8.4% to €57.3 billion, mainly due to the 
increase in inventories and marketable securities. Total assets 
amounted to €162.3 (154.3) billion as of December 31, 2015.  
Equity declined by €4.1 billion to €54.6 billion, despite the 
healthy earnings performance before special items. Noncurrent 
liabilities increased by 12.6%, while current liabilities rose by  
12.8% – this figure includes reclassifications resulting from shorter 
maturities. Both noncurrent and current provisions increased 
because of the special items, especially those relating to the diesel 
issue.

At €12.8 billion, equity was down 9.5% on the previous year. 
Noncurrent liabilities increased by 2.5% and current liabilities by 
14.6% compared with the 2014 reporting date.  
Financial Services Division balance sheet structure 
The Financial Services Division’s total assets amounted to €175.1 
billion on December 31, 2015, 13.9% higher than at the 2014 year-
end.  
The increase in lease assets and noncurrent financial services 
receivables due to the positive business performance and exchange 
rate effects saw noncurrent assets rise by 12.9% overall. Current 
assets were up 15.3% on the prior-year figure, also as a result of 
volume-related factors and exchange rate effects. Within this item, 
current financial services receivables increased by €2.6 billion to 
€47.5 billion, while cash and cash equivalents rose by €2.6 billion 
to €5.2 billion. The Financial Services Division accounted for 
approximately 45.8% of the Volkswagen Group’s assets at the 
reporting date.  
At €20.9 billion, the Financial Services Division’s equity as of 
December 31, 2015 exceeded the prior-year figure by 20.3%. In 
addition to earnings growth, equity was pushed up by capital 
increases implemented by Volkswagen AG to finance the growth in 
business and meet regulatory capital requirements. The equity ratio 
was 11.9 (11.3)%. Noncurrent liabilities rose by 12.1% and current 
liabilities increased by 13.8% as against year-end 2014. In both 
cases, this was attributable to the funding of volume growth and 
exchange rate effects. At €26.5 (25.3) billion, deposits from direct 
banking business were higher than in the previous year. The debt to 
equity ratio amounted to 7:1. ",,,,,,,,,,

company in the past fiscal year as its contribution to the gross 
domestic product of its home country, and how it is appropriated. 
The value added generated by the Volkswagen Group in the year under review was down 20.5% year-on-year in particular as a result 
of the negative special items in connection with the diesel issue. 
Added value per employee declined to €80.1 thousand (–

123 RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI) AND VALUE CONTRIBUTION  
The Volkswagen Group’s financial target system centers on contin-
uously and sustainably increasing the value of the Company. We 
have been using the return on investment (
ROI) and value con-
tribution*, a key performance indicator linked to the cost of capital, 
for a number of years in order to use resources in the Automotive 
Division efficiently and to measure the success of this.  
The concept of value-based management allows the success of 
the Automotive Division and individual business units to be evalu-
ated. It also enables the earnings power of our products, product 
lines and projects – such as new plants – to be measured. 
Components of value contribution 
Value contribution is calculated on the basis of the operating result 
after tax and the opportunity cost of invested capital. The operating 
result shows the economic performance of the Automotive Division 
and is initially a pre-tax figure. 
Using the various international income tax rates of the relevant 
companies, we assume an overall average tax rate of 30% when 
calculating the operating result after tax. 
The cost of capital is multiplied by the invested capital to give 
the opportunity cost of capital. Invested capital is calculated as total 
operating assets (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, 
lease assets, inventories and receivables) less non-interest-bearing 
liabilities (trade payables and payments on account received). 
As the concept of value-based management only comprises our 
operating activities, assets relating to investments in subsidiaries 
and associates and the investment of cash funds are not included 
when calculating invested capital. Interest charged on these assets 
is reported in the financial result. 
Determining the current cost of capital 
The cost of capital is the weighted average of the required rates of 
return on equity and debt. The cost of equity is determined using the 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (
CAPM). 
This model uses the yield on long-term risk-free Bunds, 
increased by the risk premium attaching to investments in the 
equity market. The risk premium comprises a general market risk 
and a specific business risk.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
*  The value contribution corresponds to the Economic Value Added (EVA®). EVA® is a 
registered trademark of Stern Stewart & Co. 
 The general risk premium of 6.5% reflects the general risk of a 
capital investment in the equity market and is oriented on the 
Morgan Stanley Capital International ( MSCI) World Index.  
The specific business risk – price fluctuations in Volkswagen 
preferred shares – has been modeled in comparison to the 
MSCI 
World Index when calculating the beta factor. The 
MSCI World 
Index is a global capital market benchmark for investors. 
The analysis period for the beta factor calculation spans five 
years with annual beta figures on a daily basis and an average 
subsequently being calculated. A beta factor of 1.28 (1.38) was 
determined for 2015.

borrowing costs are tax-deductible, the cost of debt is adjusted to 
account for the tax rate of 30%. 
A weighting on the basis of a fixed ratio for the fair values of

REPORTING PERIOD 
The operating result after tax of the Automotive Division, including 
the proportionate operating result of the Chinese joint ventures, 
was €–203 (11,734) million in fiscal year 2015. The year-on-year 
decrease was primarily due to negative special items as a result of 
the diesel issue. In addition, profit was negatively impacted by 
declining vehicle volumes, higher depreciation and amortization 
charges due to the high volume of capital expenditures, higher 
research and development costs, and market support measures 
linked to the emissions issue. Optimized product costs, improve-
ments in the mix and more favorable exchange rates had an 
offsetting effect. Effects on earnings and assets from purchase price 
allocation are not taken into account as they cannot be influenced 
operationally by management.  
Invested capital rose to €84,289 (78,889) million, primarily due 
to increased investments in property, plant and equipment, invest-
ment property and intangible assets, excluding capitalized develop-
ment costs (capex), and higher capitalized development costs.  The return on investment ( ROI) is the return on invested capital for 
a particular period based on the operating result after tax. It was 
down significantly year-on-year, mainly as a result of the negative 
special items in operating result, and at –0.2 (14.9)% did not meet 
our minimum required rate of return of 9%. 
At €5,732 (6,074) million, the opportunity cost of capital 
(invested capital multiplied by cost of capital) was down on the 
prior-year level due to decreased cost of capital. Operating result 
after tax was negatively impacted by special items and led to a value 
contribution of €–5,935 (5,660) million after the opportunity cost of 
invested capital.

125 SUMMARY OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC POSITION  
The Board of Management of Volkswagen AG considers business 
development and the economic position to have been strained. 
Especially the irregularities in the software used in certain diesel 
engines posed major challenges for the Company. In addition, the 
increasingly difficult conditions in the Brazilian, Chinese and 
Russian vehicle markets led to a decline in deliveries to customers 
compared with the previous year. Contrary to our original forecast, 
deliveries of 9.9 million vehicles (–2.0%) failed to exceed the 2014 
level. Group sales revenue increased year-on-year, as forecast, and 
was above the forecast range – due to exchange rate effects, among 
other factors. In particular, the provisions recognized in 
connection with the diesel issue weighed on the Group’s operating 
result and operating return on sales; both figures were down 
significantly on the previous year and the forecast ranges. 
Excluding special items, the Group’s operating result was on a level 
with 2014, at €12.8 billion. The operating return on sales before 
special items was in the expected range, at 6.0%.  
Sales revenue of the business areas was also up on the respec-
tive prior-year figure. While special items resulted in the operating 
result and the operating return on sales of the Passenger Cars 
Business Area falling short of the forecast ranges, the Commercial 
Vehicles/Power Engineering Business Area confirmed the forecast, despite special items from restructuring measures. The Financial 
Services Division’s operating result exceeded the previous year’s 
figure.  
Although at 6.9% the ratio of capex to sales revenue in the Auto-
motive Division was higher than in 2014, it was within the expected 
range. The Automotive Division’s net cash flow exceeded the prior 
year’s figure because of the sale of the shares in Suzuki. In addition, 
the successful placement of dual-tranche hybrid notes strength-
ened our capital base. The Automotive Division’s net liquidity was 
€6.9 billion higher at the end of the reporting period than at the end 
of December 2014. The decline in the operating result attributable 
to special items led to a significant decrease in the Automotive Divi-
sion’s return on investment (ROI), which fell short of the minimum 
required rate of return on invested capital. 
Volkswagen does not tolerate any infringements of rules or laws. 
The trust of our customers and the public is, and will remain, our 
most important asset. We will do everything within our power to 
prevent incidents of these kinds from reoccurring and commit 
ourselves fully to winning back all of the trust. Through our tech-
nologies, vehicles and services, we will contribute to shaping the 
future of mobility with courage and conviction. 
The following table shows an overview of the targets set for the 
reporting period and the figures actually achieved.

126  ANNUAL RESULT 
Special items relating to the emissions issue, and in particular 
provisions for technical measures and legal risks, impacted cost of 
sales (€7.5 billion), selling expenses (€0.8 billion) and the other 
operating result (€6.7 billion). 
In fiscal year 2015, Volkswagen AG’s sales were 6.6% higher 
than in the previous year, at €73.5 billion. Sales generated abroad 
accounted for a share of 62.1 (62.3)%. Cost of sales increased by 
15.9% to €75.7 billion; as a result, gross profit on sales declined to 
€–2.2 (3.7) billion.

year-on-year. The reasons for this include considerably higher 
provisions for legal and litigation risks. 
The financial result increased to €13.8 (6.1) billion, more than 
doubling compared with 2014. The increase was primarily attri-
butable to higher net investment income.  
Volkswagen AG’s result from ordinary activities declined to  
€–4.8 (4.2) billion. After deducting income taxes, the net loss for the 
year was €–5.5 billion.

127 NET ASSETS AND FINANCIAL POSITION 
Total assets amounted to €133.5 billion at December 31, 2015, 
€17.4 billion up on the prior-year figure. At €2.7 (2.8) billion, invest-
ments in tangible and intangible assets were on a level with the 
previous year. Investments in financial assets declined by €9.2 bil-
lion to €9.1 (18.2) billion. Fixed assets accounted for a share of 
71.1 (75.0)% of total assets. 
Current assets (including prepaid expenses) increased by a total 
of €9.5 billion to €38.6 billion, driven among other factors by 
lending activities and a significant rise in investment income 
receivable from affiliated companies. 
Equity amounted to €24.4 billion at the end of the reporting 
period; the €4.1 billion decrease year-on-year was primarily due to 
the impact on earnings of the emissions issue. The capital increase 
resulting from the settlement of the mandatory convertible notes 
had a positive effect. The equity ratio was 18.3 (24.5)%.  
Other provisions increased by €15.9 billion year-on-year to a 
total of €28.6 billion. This is primarily attributable to higher 
warranty provisions and provisions for legal risks resulting from the 
diesel issue. Due to intragroup agreements, these provisions also 
cover risks that arise at other Volkswagen Group brands. Provisions 
for pensions and similar obligations rose by €1.2 billion to 
€14.3 billion, primarily due to changes in the discount rate, while 
provisions for taxes decreased by €0.7 billion  to  €4.6 billion.  The 
€5.0 billion rise in total liabilities (including deferred income) to 
€61.5 billion is mainly attributable to higher liabilities to banks. 
Volkswagen AG’s cash funds, comprising cash instruments with 
a maturity of less than three months, less bank and cash pooling liabilities repayable on demand, declined by €1.6 billion year-on-
year to €–5.1 billion, due in particular to the expansion of intra-
group financing activities. 
At €51.4 (48.2) billion, the interest-bearing portion of debt was 
up on the previous year. 
In our assessment, the economic position of Volkswagen AG is 
as strained as that of the Volkswagen Group. 
DIVIDEND PROPOSAL 
Following the release of revenue reserves amounting to €5.6 billion, 
net retained profits amount to €69.2 million. The Board of Manage-
ment and Supervisory Board are proposing to pay a total dividend of 
€67.5 million, i.e. €0.11 per ordinary share and €0.17 per pre-
ferred share.

128  VEHICLE SALES  
Volkswagen AG sold a total of 2,676,629 vehicles in fiscal year 2015, 
up 2.3% on the previous year. The proportion of vehicles sold 
outside Germany was 69.4 (69.3)%. 
 
PRODUCTION 
Volkswagen AG produced a total of 1,255,771 vehicles at its vehicle 
production plants in Wolfsburg, Hanover and Emden in the 
reporting period, up 2.0% year-on-year. Volkswagen AG’s average 
daily production was up on the previous year, at 5,279 units. 
 
EMPLOYEES 
As of December 31, 2015, a total of 114,066 people were employed 
at the sites of Volkswagen AG, excluding staff employed at sub-
sidiaries. Of this figure, 5,055 were vocational trainees. 3,373 
employees were in the passive phase of their partial retirement. The 
workforce grew by 1.3% as against the prior-year reporting date. 
Female employees accounted for 16.6% of the workforce. 
Volkswagen AG employed 4,255 part-time workers (3.7%). The 
percentage of foreign employees was 6.0%. The proportion of 
employees in the production area who have completed vocational 
training relevant for Volkswagen was 83.3%. 18.4% of the 
employees were graduates. The average age of employees in fiscal 
year 2015 was 42.9 years. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Research and development costs for Volkswagen AG under the 
German Commercial Code amounted to €5.3 (4.9) billion in 2015. 
12,342 people were employed in this area at the end of the 
reporting period.   PURCHASING VOLUME 
The purchasing volume across the six Volkswagen AG sites in 
Germany totaled €28.0 (27.2) billion in fiscal year 2015; the 
proportion attributable to German suppliers was 65.9 (67.7)%. Of 
the total purchasing volume, €22.6 billion was spent on production 
materials and €5.4 billion on capital goods and services. 
 
EXPENDITURE ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
Expenditure on environmental protection measures is split 
between investments and operating costs for production-related 
environmental protection. Of our total investments, only those that 
are spent exclusively or primarily on environmental protection are 
included in environmental protection investments. We distinguish 
here between additive and integrated investments. Additive 
environmental protection measures are separate investments that 
are independent of other investments relating to the production 
process. They can be upstream or downstream of the production 
process. In contrast to additive environmental protection measures, 
the environmental impact is already reduced during the product 
development phase in the case of integrated measures. In 2015 we 
invested primarily in water pollution control and air pollution 
control. 
The operating costs recognized for environmental protection 
relate exclusively to production-related measures that protect the 
environment against harmful factors by avoiding, reducing, or 
eliminating emissions by the Company. Resources are also 
conserved. For example, these include expenditures incurred to 
operate equipment that protects the environment as well as 
expenditures for measures not relating to such equipment. Our 
focus in 2015 was on water pollution control, waste management 
and air pollution control.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement  
130  The main financial key performance indicators for the Volkswagen 
Group are described in the “Results of Operations, Financial 
Position and Net Assets” chapter. Nonfinancial key performance 
indicators also attest to the effectiveness of our Company’s value 
drivers. These include our processes in the areas of research and 
development, procurement, production, marketing and sales, 
information technology and quality assurance. In all of these 
processes, we are aware of our responsibility towards our 
customers, our employees, the environment and society. In this 
chapter, we show how we increase the value of our Company in a 
sustainable way using examples. 
 
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY 
The Volkswagen Group is committed to transparent and respon-
sible corporate governance. Implementing this across all levels and 
every step of the value chain is a challenge: with twelve brands, 119 
production locations and more than 610,000 employees, we are 
one of the world’s largest companies.  
For the Volkswagen Group, sustainability means simultaneously 
striving for economic, social and environmental goals in a way that 
gives them equal priority. We want to create enduring value, provide 
good working conditions and handle the environment and 
resources with care. In conjunction with the emissions issue, Volks-
wagen has failed to meet its own standards in a number of respects. 
The irregularities in our handling of emissions figures are contrary 
to everything Volkswagen stands for. We deeply regret this and are 
aware that we disappointed our stakeholders. We are doing 
everything in our power to make sure that the same thing never 
happens again. We are working urgently to live up to our own 
standards again and restore our customers’ and society’s confi-
dence. We are comprehensively revising our sustainability concept. 
This is aimed at ensuring that we recognize risks and development 
opportunities in the areas of environment, society and governance 
at an early stage at every step along the value chain. In this way, our 
corporate social responsibility (
CSR) activities will contribute to permanently boosting our Company’s reputation and value again in 
the long term.  Management and coordination  
The Volkswagen Group has created a clear management structure 
for coordinating sustainability and 
CSR. Its highest committee is 
the Group Board of Management (Sustainability Board). It is 
regularly informed by the Group 
CSR & Sustainability steering 
group on the issues of sustainability and corporate responsibility. 
The Group 
CSR & Sustainability steering group’s members include 
executives from central Board of Management business areas and 
representatives of the Group Works Council and of the brands and 
regions. Among other things, the steering group makes decisions 
on the strategic sustainability goals, monitors the extent to which 
they are being met using management indicators, identifies key 
action areas and approves the sustainability report.  
The 
CSR & Sustainability office supports the steering group. Its 
duties include coordinating all sustainability activities within the 
Group and the brands, but also coordinating the stakeholder dialog 
at Group level, for example with sustainability-driven analysts and 
investors. 
CSR project teams work on topics across business areas, 
such as reporting, stakeholder management, or sustainability in 
supplier relationships. This coordination and working structure is 
also largely established across the brands and is constantly 
expanding. Since 2009, the 
CSR & Sustainability coordinators for 
all brands and regions have come together once a year to promote 
communication across the Group, establish consistent structures 
and learn from one another. This Group 
CSR meeting has proven 
itself an integral part of the Group-wide coordination structure. At 
the end of the reporting period, in light of the diesel issue we 
discussed the Group’s sustainability performance based on an 
analysis of strengths and weaknesses. The results are being looked 
at in-depth in the sustainability committees and are being 
incorporated in the Group’s comprehensive realignment. 
   
 S
ustainable  Value 
Enhancement 
Volkswagen does not tolerate any infringements of rules or laws. We will do 
everything in our power to earn our Stakeholders’ trust back. We strive for a comprehensive 
realignment. Our goal is to run our business responsibly along the entire value chain. Everyone should 
benefit from this – our customers, our employees, the environment and society.",,,,,,,,,,

CODE OF CONDUCT AND GUIDELINES 
Our Code of Conduct, which is applicable throughout the Group, 
provides guidance for our employees in the event of legal and 
ethical challenges in their daily work. It embodies the Group values 
of customer focus, top performance, creating value, renewability, 
respect, responsibility and sustainability. All employees are equally 
responsible for adhering to these principles.  
International conventions, regulations and internal rules are 
also key guidelines for our conduct. Through the “Declaration on 
Social Rights and Industrial Relationships at Volkswagen” (Volks-
wagen Social Charter), the Charter on Labor Relations, the Charter 
on Temporary Work and the Charter on Vocational Education and 
Training, we also profess our commitment to fundamental human 
rights, labor standards and principles.  
Strategic stakeholder management 
We cannot be successful in the long term without communicating 
with our stakeholders and knowing their expectations. As the 
complexity of the Volkswagen Group increases, so do the 
expectations of and our network of relationships with the various 
stakeholders. Our communication with stakeholders therefore 
covers many aspects, ranging from expectation management to 
innovation momentum, to identifying opportunities and risks. We  
 
are open to a constructive and equitable dialog where we learn from 
one another. Our goal is to agree on a common solution, but at the 
very least each to gain a mutual understanding of the other’s initial 
situation and position.  
Our brands in particular hold intensive dialogs with their 
stakeholders. We pool this communication at Group level in order 
to be able to discuss Group-wide issues in detail. In this context, we 
are also involved in organizations that concentrate on issues related 
to sustainable development. On an international level, for example, 
we are represented in  CSR Europe, a leading European business 
network. We are putting our involvement in some organizations on 
hold for the time being in light of the investigation and clarification 
of the diesel issue. This applies to our memberships of Biodiversity 
in Good Company e.V., the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (
WBCSD) and the UN Global Compact, and our 
management board activities at econsense, the Forum for Sustain-
able Development of German Business. 
The insights we gain from dialog with our stakeholders are 
indispensable signposts and indicators of our Company’s future 
viability. We publish information about the stakeholder dialogs in 
our annual sustainability report so that our communication with 
stakeholders is understandable and transparent. Stakeholder 
management is steered and coordinated by the Group

respect, responsibility and sustainability. All employees are equally 
responsible for adhering to these principles.  
International conventions, regulations and internal rules are 
also key guidelines for our conduct. Through the “Declaration on 
Social Rights and Industrial Relationships at Volkswagen” (Volks-
wagen Social Charter), the Charter on Labor Relations, the Charter 
on Temporary Work and the Charter on Vocational Education and 
Training, we also profess our commitment to fundamental human 
rights, labor standards and principles.  
Strategic stakeholder management 
We cannot be successful in the long term without communicating 
with our stakeholders and knowing their expectations. As the 
complexity of the Volkswagen Group increases, so do the 
expectations of and our network of relationships with the various 
stakeholders. Our communication with stakeholders therefore 
covers many aspects, ranging from expectation management to 
innovation momentum, to identifying opportunities and risks. We 
  

 
are open to a constructive and equitable dialog where we learn from 
one another. Our goal is to agree on a common solution, but at the 
very least each to gain a mutual understanding of the other’s initial 
situation and position.  
Our brands in particular hold intensive dialogs with their 
stakeholders. We pool this communication at Group level in order 
to be able to discuss Group-wide issues in detail. In this context, we 
are also involved in organizations that concentrate on issues related 
to sustainable development. On an international level, for example, 
we are represented in 
CSR Europe, a leading European business 
network. We are putting our involvement in some organizations on 
hold for the time being in light of the investigation and clarification 
of the diesel issue. This applies to our memberships of Biodiversity 
in Good Company e.V., the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (
WBCSD) and the UN Global Compact, and our 
management board activities at econsense, the Forum for Sustain-
able Development of German Business. 
The insights we gain from dialog with our stakeholders are 
indispensable signposts and indicators of our Company’s future 
viability. We publish information about the stakeholder dialogs in 
our annual sustainability report so that our communication with 
stakeholders is understandable and transparent. Stakeholder 
management is steered and coordinated by the Group

and by the project teams of the brands and regions. For the project 
teams we have specifically selected representatives of the relevant 
specialist areas. This enables us to react quickly to the diverse 
requirements of stakeholders. 
Our stakeholder management consists of a variety of instru-
ments: dialogs, workshops, symposiums, public debates, social 
media, questionnaires, evaluations and projects. In order to sys-
tematically manage all these activities, we document them in an IT-
based stakeholder management system.  
In 2015, we used the results of the comprehensive stakeholder 
questionnaires from brands and companies to identify key issues. 
In order to systematically prioritize the issues identified, we 
evaluate them using the latest international sustainability studies 
and benchmark them against the guidelines and conventions that 
Volkswagen is committed to. Internal bodies that also involve all 
brands and regions discuss and evaluate the key issues. These 
discussions center around three main criteria: 
> the expectations of stakeholders, 
> the significance for the Company and  
> the extent to which the Company can influence these issues.  
The results give us the Volkswagen Group’s key action areas for 
achieving our sustainability goal.  
 
CSR Projects 
The Volkswagen group initiates and manages a variety of  CSR 
projects around the world, which are based on the following key 
principles: 
> The projects are compatible with the Group’s principles while at 
the same time addressing a specific local or regional issue. 
> They demonstrate the diversity in the Group and in the social 
environment in which they are implemented. 
> They are the result of close stakeholder dialog with the local 
players involved in implementation. 
> Project management is the responsibility of the local units 
working on the project. 
The Volkswagen Group supports the arts and culture, education, 
science, health and sport in a large number of projects; other 
initiatives serve to develop regional structures and conserve nature. 
These projects make 
CSR a learning platform for all brands and in 
all of the Company’s regions. Examples include our cooperation 
with the German Red Cross (
DRK) and our efforts to help refugees.  
Humanity, public spirit and responsibility – these are the values 
on which the work of the German Red Cross is based, and we in the 
Volkswagen Group share these values. We are promoting sound, 
balanced social development, in Germany and at our other 
international locations. As part of a strategic partnership, the 
Volkswagen Group helps the German Red Cross to find even more people who are willing to volunteer their time. This goal is central to 
the partnership, in conjunction with strengthening the Red Cross’s 
rescue service. 
Under the motto “Helping Together”, we are joining in the 
collective task of receiving and integrating the refugees who come to 
Europe and Germany. This is accomplished through a wide variety 
of projects, starting with immediate aid in the initial accom-
modation facilities to local integration and education projects, on to 
providing vehicles and non-monetary resources. A newly created 
Internet platform serves as a volunteer database and a source of 
information to support active volunteer helpers. This is because we 
are convinced that with their help, the Volkswagen Group, its 
brands, locations and employees can not only make a humanitarian 
contribution, but thereby also contribute to the cohesion of society.  
Our long-standing cooperation and consultancy agreement 
with the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union 
( NABU) expired on December 31, 2015. Extension of the contract 
and further collaboration are suspended for the time being as a 
result of the diesel issue. We would like to continue our strategic 
partnership with 
NABU and are working intensively on creating the 
conditions required for this. 
“FUTURE TRACKS” 
The automotive industry is facing the greatest upheavals in its 
history. Alternative drive systems, the digitization of the entire value 
chain and rapidly changing global customer expectations of 
mobility will shape the coming years. In response, the Volkswagen 
Group has launched the “Future Tracks” program: we are devel-
oping solutions for the fundamental upheavals and challenges at 
Board of Management and senior executive level. “Future Tracks” 
brings together all topics, activities and measures that we are 
deploying now and will be deploying in the coming years to prepare 
for the major issues of the future – across all brands and regions 
and throughout the entire Group. 
From a technical viewpoint, our work focuses on drive tech-
nologies, digitization and the networking of products and 
production. Added to this are new requirements for individual 
mobility and mobility-related services. Our efforts aim to ensure 
that the Volkswagen Group takes a leading role in shaping and 
influencing the new world of mobility. 
A solid commercial basis is essential to be able to tackle these 
challenges successfully. For this reason, “Future Tracks” has been 
introduced not only as a forward-looking program – it also focuses 
on efficiency. Our intention is to continue to grow profitably, 
ensuring that we are always in the position to invest in the future of 
the Volkswagen Group. We are thus creating the foundations to 
shape the automotive transition and to ensure long-term success.",,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 
The Volkswagen Group’s research and development activities in 
fiscal year 2015 concentrated on expanding our product portfolio 
and improving the functionality, quality, safety and environmental 
compatibility of our products.  
A central challenge for Volkswagen is to recognize new develop-
ments in society, politics, technology, the environment and the 
economy at an early stage. These form an important basis for 
innovations and thus our business success. The Volkswagen Group’s 
research constantly addresses the latest trends and has established 
research offices in the key global automotive markets – including in 
China, Japan and the United States. They monitor technological 
areas relevant to the automotive industry, conduct cooperative 
projects with research institutions and local companies, thereby 
gaining enlightening new insights for the Volkswagen Group. 
Fuel and drivetrain strategy 
The Volkswagen Group invested €11.9 billion in research and 
development in fiscal year 2015. The majority of this was spent on 
efficiency-increasing technologies. After reviewing the CO
2 issue, 
the vehicles’ emissions figures of only a very limited number of 
engine-transmission variants have to be adjusted in the course of 
normal processes. The Volkswagen Group’s new passenger car fleet 
in the EU (excluding Lamborghini and Bentley) emitted an average 
of 120.8 g CO
2/km* in the reporting period and thus complied with 
the 2015 European limit of 130 g CO
2/km. The Lamborghini and 
Bentley brands each have an independent fleet for the purposes of 
the European CO
2 legislation and complied with their individual 
targets. We currently offer a total of 608 model variants (engine-
transmission combinations) that emit less than 130 g CO
2/km. For 
489 model variants, we are already below the threshold of 
120 g CO
2/km. 145 model variants in fact remain below 100 g 
  CO 2/km. 87 model variants are already below the European fleet 
target of 95 g CO
2/km valid from 2021 (see chart on page 135). 
The Volkswagen Group’s fuel and drivetrain strategy is paving 
the way for carbon-neutral and sustainable mobility. Our goal is to 
increase drive system efficiency with each new model generation  
– irrespective of whether they are powered by combustion engines, 
hybrids, plug-in hybrids, pure electric drives, or potential future 
fuel cell drive systems. All of our mobility concepts are tailored to 
our customers’ needs. This will expand the portfolio of different 
drive systems and will lead to a future situation where there is 
greater coexistence of traditional drive systems and e-mobility side 
by side. The current modular toolkits are designed so that the full 
range of drive systems can be deployed and flexibly mounted on 
product lines across our global locations. In addition, there will be a 
Modular Electrification Toolkit in future that will form the 
backbone of upcoming electric vehicles.  
From today’s perspective, the combustion engine looks set to 
serve as the broad basis for drive technology in the coming years. In 
the interest of using resources responsibly, it is therefore crucial to 
further optimize combustion engines. Our new generations of 
petrol and diesel engines satisfy this requirement. When it comes to 
vehicles with conventional drive systems, we have significantly 
reduced average fuel consumption. We achieved this in particular 
with the aid of efficiency-increasing measures. These include the

use of our dual clutch, lightweight construction and the improve-
ment of aerodynamics. Natural gas engines play a key role in the 
drivetrain portfolio. Due to the chemical composition of the fuel, 
the CO
2 emissions are around 25% below those of petrol. Our 
customers can, for instance, experience this for themselves with the 
Caddy 
TGI, which was introduced in 2015 as the successor to the 
Caddy EcoFuel. With almost the same performance compared to its 
predecessor, the smaller engine of the Caddy 
TGI clearly delivers 
significantly better acceleration and saves up to 1.7 kg of gas per 
100 km due to its turbocharger. Natural gas is also an economic and 
clean drive system for heavy commercial vehicles. Liquefied natural 
gas (
LNG) must replace compressed natural gas ( CNG) for these 
engines to be used in long-distance trucks and buses, since this is 
the only way the required energy density and hence the desired 
range can be achieved. Better infrastructure is needed for natural 
gas to be widely usable as a fuel. For example, natural gas filling 
station networks have only been sufficiently developed in a few 
countries. With the new P280, Scania introduced its fourth 
generation of commercial vehicles fueled by bioethanol and thus 
strengthened its position as the commercial vehicle manufacturer 
with the widest range of vehicles with renewable fuels. The Euro-6 
trucks and buses from 
MAN can also be fueled by biodiesel and bio 
natural gas in several drive system variants. 
We are expanding our traditional range of engines through 
drivetrain electrification. The percentage of drivers traveling 
predominantly short distances is growing. These include com-
muters and city residents, but also delivery vehicles in urban areas. 
The population shift towards urban areas continues unabated, and 
by no means is this limited to just the burgeoning megacities of Asia 
and South America. Purely electric vehicles like the e-up! and e-Golf  
  are emission-free and thus of particular interest to customers 
whose everyday driving covers short and medium distances. Oppor-
tunities to charge privately – e.g. using a charging station installed 
at a customer’s location – must be supplemented by a good public 
recharging infrastructure in the medium to long term. 
However, most customers also want to take their vehicles on 
longer trips. Hybrid vehicles, in particular plug-in hybrids, combine 
highly efficient combustion engines with zero-emission electric 
motors. Where this combination of drive concepts is concerned, 
Volkswagen sees an opportunity to offer electrified models for all 
mobility needs to customers of a wide range of vehicle classes, to 
build trust in the new technologies, and thus to help e-mobility gain 
acceptance. We have been offering hybrid versions in a range of 
vehicle classes for several years. In 2015, we introduced further 
plug-in hybrid models with the Passat  GTE and the Audi Q7 e-tron.  
The Volkswagen Group’s toolkit strategy realizes substantial 
synergies through using modules across model series and brands. 
The vehicle architecture is designed so that all drive system types 
can be integrated flexibly and economically. This applies in 
particular for models that are based on the same platform; for 
example, they can use a single plug-in hybrid system consisting of a 
highly-efficient turbo petrol engine, an electric motor, our compact 
six-speed dual clutch and a lithium-ion battery. We have integrated 
the production of electrified vehicles into the manufacturing 
processes at our existing plants, e.g. in Wolfsburg, Emden, 
Bratislava, Ingolstadt and Leipzig.  
The battery is the heart of an electric vehicle and its energy 
content is the deciding factor in determining the vehicle’s range. 
Currently we use lithium-ion cells for all-electric and plug-in hybrid 
vehicles, which we assemble to battery systems in our Braun-

schweig factory. Battery types based on solid electrolytes, which 
have a higher energy density and also meet stricter safety standards, 
are currently being researched. The industrial application of this 
technology is currently being reviewed. The next generation of 
electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will be fitted with improved 
lithium-ion technology. Electric motors are manufactured at our 
plant in Kassel. Electric vehicles based on the Modular Longi-
tudinal Toolkit (
MLB) will be produced locally in China from 2016. 
Electric vehicles based on the Modular Transverse Toolkit (
MQB) 
will follow at a later date. For models based on the 
MQB in 
particular, localization of the core components including the high-
voltage battery system is planned. 
Hydrogen will still not be widely available as a fuel in the 
medium term. Both hydrogen filling stations and renewable 
hydrogen production plants will have to be constructed. Volkswagen 
has been working on fuel cell technologies for over 15 years and has 
gained extensive experience operating test fleets. The decision on 
whether to proceed to series production will depend on market 
requirements and infrastructure. 
Thanks to our conventional and alternative technologies and 
the modular toolkit strategy, which allows innovations to be 
incorporated rapidly into different vehicles, we are optimally 
positioned to meet the challenges that the future will bring. We have 
expanded our expertise in electric traction with the help of 
additional technical specialists and experts. 
Lifecycle engineering 
Innovations and new technologies for reducing fuel consumption 
alone are not enough to minimize the effect of vehicles on the 
environment. This is because long before the wheels of a car turn 
  for the first time, raw materials need to be extracted and materials 
and components manufactured.  
This means that the assessment of new vehicles, components 
and materials begins before they are even produced: from the first 
idea and design sketches, through production and the subsequent 
usage phase, to recycling. We therefore consider a vehicle’s impact on 
the environment throughout the entire product lifecycle. To achieve 
this, we produce lifecycle analyses in accordance with  ISO stan-
dards 14040 and 14044. By applying these we can determine where 
improvements have the greatest effect and develop innovations that 
target these points directly. We call this lifecycle engineering. 
We regularly inform our customers, shareholders and other 
interested groups about the success stories of our environmentally 
responsible vehicle development and lifecycle assessments. The 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand publishes so-called environ-
mental ratings showing the ecological advances in new vehicle 
models compared with their immediate predecessors; Audi 
publishes this information under the heading of “environmental 
footprint”.  
As we want to minimize our vehicles’ impact on the environ-
ment together with our suppliers, Volkswagen joined the 
CDP 
supply chain program in 2015. We have also carried out workshops 
with some suppliers in order to find common innovative 
approaches to environmentally optimize certain components.  
In cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, we 
further developed our methods for calculating the so-called water 
footprint in 2015. On the basis of the environmental footprint, we 
calculate and analyze the amount of water consumed by a vehicle 
during its entire lifecycle and are thus able to take specific measures 
to reduce water consumption.

136  Recycling 
Recycling makes a key contribution to reducing our products’ 
impact on the environment and conserving resources. It is not just a 
matter of recycling vehicles at the end of their service life – on the 
contrary, even at the development stage for new vehicles, we pay 
attention to the recyclability of the required materials, the use of 
high-quality recycled material and the avoidance of pollutants. At 
the same time, we factor in aspects of the use phase, for instance the 
treatment and disposal of service fluids or high-wear components.  
Volkswagen is also constantly working on developing and 
enhancing recycling methods, processes and technologies. With 
VW-SiCon process – which has won several awards –we have 
developed a process that allows end-of-life vehicles to be 85% 
recycled and 95% recovered. This complies with the regulatory 
requirements that have been in force in the EU since the beginning 
of the reporting period. We are developing modern technologies for 
recycling components from electric vehicles with our partners as 
part of the LithoRec (lithium-ion battery recycling) and ElmoReL 
(electric vehicle recycling – key components in power electronics) 
research projects.  
Last but not least in this area, we have the Volkswagen Passen-
ger Cars brand’s Genuine Exchange Parts program. Our industrial 
reconditioning produces high-quality exchange parts that conserve 
resources and offer the same quality, functionality and warranty but 
are on average 40% cheaper than the corresponding new parts.  
Intelligent mobility 
Mobility is one of the key conditions for economic growth and 
sustainable development. It is thus necessary to meet the growing 
need for mobility despite the ever-decreasing availability of 
resources. Mobility must be made more efficient and waste avoided. 
In order to address this challenge, the “number one for intelligent 
mobility” target area has been included in the Group environ-
mental strategy (see 160). Volkswagen wants to set standards with 
integrated, intelligent mobility solutions and innovative transport 
systems. To this end, we are opening up new fields of business and 
developing novel business models. 
Given the variety of needs and local conditions for mobility, one 
possible solution alone will not be enough. Volkswagen is therefore 
working on various approaches, from innovative vehicle concepts 
right through to research into innovative urban developments. 
However, the solutions can only be fully effective if they are 
networked together and employed at the right time and in the right 
place. They require the efficient interplay of people, infrastructure, 
technologies and means of transport.  
Since 2013, Volkswagen has been working with 14 other 
companies from different sectors in six cities across the world on 
the Sustainable Mobility Project 2.0 launched by the 
WBCSD. In the 
third and final year of the project, proposed solutions were 
  developed for those cities that want to implement them as part of 
their mobility plans.  
In the reporting period, the  UR:BAN (Urban Space: User-
oriented assistance systems and network management) research 
initiative also presented the results of its work after four years of 
research. 31 partners from the automotive and supplier industry, 
the electronics and software sector, research institutions and cities 
– and including Volkswagen Group Research and the Audi and 
MAN 
brands – were involved. Within the fields of cognitive assistance, 
human factors in traffic and networked traffic systems, the project 
participants in joint research work have developed new driver 
assistance and traffic management systems for complex traffic 
situations in urban traffic. 
Digitalization and networking 
Networking of the vehicle to other vehicles, the environment, 
infrastructure and mobile devices is advancing and increases the 
safety, comfort and driving enjoyment for driver and passengers. 
Innovations from this area are finding their way into numerous of 
our Group brands’ models. With the latest generation of the 
Modular Infotainment Toolkit, content from digital devices can be 
managed and played on the radio or navigation system using the 
App-Connect function in a large number of Volkswagen models, 
such as the new Touran. The “Car-Net Cam Connect"" feature is also 
available for the first time in the new Touran: Thanks to a net-
worked camera, the driver can now keep an eye on children, pets or 
sensitive loads in the rear, because the camera image is transmitted 
to the monitor of the infotainment system. The new Audi A4 is 
connected to the Internet via Audi connect using the fast 
LT E wire-
less communication standard. Passengers can use their mobile 
devices via the Wi-Fi hotspot. In addition, all available Audi connect 
services and safety features such as emergency call and online 
roadside assistance call are available in the vehicle, as is the 
MMI 
connect app for remote functions. An Audi tablet for entertaining 
the vehicle’s occupants, sound systems with 3D sound from Bang & 
Olufsen and Bose and the Audi Phone Box, which wirelessly 
connects the mobile telephone to the car’s external aerial and 
charges it inductively, underscore the ingenuity.  
In many new Audi models, the Audi virtual cockpit displays 
vividly sharp and highly detailed information on driving, navigation 
and assistance features, for example high-resolution maps in full 
screen mode including Google Earth’s satellite view. The Audi 
virtual cockpit also provides a newly developed 
MMI control con-
cept with voice command and a free text search feature. 
Along with the new infotainment features and display options, 
we are continuously enhancing the gesture control and voice 
command in the vehicles. Volkswagen’s newest infotainment 
systems already use a proximity sensor. If a hand approaches the 
display, it automatically switches over from a purely informative

137 level to a more structured menu with large operating controls. In 
the next revolutionary step, which Volkswagen introduced in 2015 
on board the Golf R Touch concept vehicle, the infotainment unit 
will precisely detect and understand hand gestures. Without 
actually touching a touchscreen, it is thus possible to operate the 
display and controls in virtual space with your movements in real 
space. A clear gain in comfort and safety. 
Another innovation resulting from digitalization is the digital 
key function. Here, the smartphone functions as a digital key that 
can be used to lock or unlock the vehicle, open and close all 
windows and start or stop the engine. The digital key can also be 
transferred to other smartphones. For example, this will make it 
possible for third parties to unload the car or service it without 
actually having the key in their hands – a new dimension for 
servicing and services. Subsequently, the temporary access to the 
car will be deactivated again. 
High performance telematics systems have already become 
common in Volkswagen Group’s heavy commercial vehicles. They 
make it possible to view vehicles’ efficiency transparently even in 
large fleets. All parameters influencing fuel consumption can be 
monitored in this way, for example correct tire pressure or 
consistent use of efficiency systems.  
Lightweight construction 
Lightweight body shell production remains a strategic development 
focus. Volkswagen uses hot-formed, high-strength steels in series 
models. We are also pursuing a vehicle- and platform-specific 
composite material approach, i.e. the use of diverse materials in a 
body shell. Lightweight materials such as aluminum are also used 
in the development of new platforms.  
Audi continues to intensively work on using lightweight 
construction to increase the dynamics of its models and at the same 
time decrease consumption. The Audi Q7 body is made largely of 
aluminum. Thanks to the Audi Space Frame construction, the 
vehicle body only weighs a little more than 200 kg. In addition, large 
components made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (
CFRP) are 
integrated in the body of the Audi R8 Coupé. In the RS models, 
various parts of the exterior and interior are made of 
CFRP. 
In 2015 Porsche presented a vehicle concept based on a 
lightweight construction design with optimum weight distribution 
and low center of gravity: the Study Mission E. The body consists of a 
functional mixture of aluminum, steel and 
CFRP, for example the 
bonnet and wheels are made of carbon fiber. 
We are also researching into economical lightweight construc-
tion technologies for series production as part of the Open Hybrid 
LabFactory public-private partnership in collaboration with the 
Lower Saxony Research Center for Vehicle Technology (
NFF) at the 
Technical University of Braunschweig, the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft 
and various other industry partners.  Lighting technology 
The Audi brand is the global leader in automotive lighting tech-
nology. The new R8 introduced in 2015 also sets new standards in 
this field. As an optional extra for it, the latest development is 
available: the laser spot for high-beam headlights. What makes 
laser light special is that it produces a range nearly twice as far as an 
LED high-beam headlight. Audi is working on the headlights of the 
future in its sponsored project “Intelligent laser light for compact 
and high-resolution adaptive headlights” alongside partners from 
industry and science. Matrix laser technology and its high reso-
lution will make illumination of the road highly adjustable. 
The next step in automotive lighting technology was displayed 
in a concept vehicle at the 
IAA in Frankfurt: the new matrix  OLED 
lights (
OLED: organic light-emitting diode). They enable a previ-
ously unknown degree of homogeneity of light and thus expand the 
creative leeway in vehicle design. In contrast to point light sources 
such as 
LEDs, which are made of semiconductor crystals,  OLEDs 
are light emitting surfaces. They will soon be able to generate turn 
signal and brake lights too. The new flexible substrate materials will 
lend themselves to three-dimensional forming. 
OLED units can also 
be subdivided into small segments that can be controlled at 
different brightness levels. In addition, there will be different colors 
and transparent 
OLED units.  
Driver assistance systems and automated driving 
In fiscal year 2015, we expanded the use of innovative driver 
assistance systems to additional vehicles. Following their first use in 
the new Passat in 2014, the Trailer Assist, the Emergency Assist and 
the Traffic Jam Assist, for example, are also available in the latest 
models of Touran, Tiguan, Audi A4 and Audi Q7. If the driver is not 
responding, the Emergency Assist makes an escalating sequence of 
attempts to wake the driver before bringing the car to an emergency 
stop. Trailer Assist makes maneuvering a vehicle with a trailer 
easier by using a rear view camera to analyze the hitch articulation 
angle and to calculate the steering angle from this. The Traffic Jam 
Assist uses Adaptive Cruise Control (
ACC) automated distance 
control and Lane Assist in order to enable partially automated 
driving in traffic jams. At a speed of 0 to 65 km/h, the car follows the 
vehicle in front, controlling the acceleration and brakes within the 
limits of the system and independently keeps itself within the lane. 
The gradual expansion of assistance systems paves the way for 
automated driving and increasingly takes the pressure off the driver. 
Volkswagen aims for the leadership position in this area of 
innovation. V-Charge, an EU research project in which we are 
working on new technologies together with five national and 
international partners, offers a glimpse of the near future of 
automated parking. The focus is on automating the search for a 
parking space and charging electric vehicles. The idea is that the 
vehicle does not just autonomously search for a free parking space, 
it also finds a free spot with charging infrastructure and charges its 
battery inductively. Once the charging process is completed, it 
releases the charging spot for another vehicle and looks for a

project in the Boston area in the 
USA. With the Trained Parking 
function, vehicles can in future be “trained” in the process for 
parking at their own home. 
In 2014, Audi showed what the technology can already do in the 
field of fully automated driving: the Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept 
completed a lap of the Hockenheim Grand Prix track at racing 
speeds – without a driver. On the Sonoma Raceway in California – 
one of the most challenging racetracks in the world – the latest 
generation of the Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept exceeded the 
previous top performance yet again in the year under review, 
making faster lap times than the racing drivers. Further successes 
included a 550 mile piloted trip with an Audi A7 piloted driving 
concept on the highway from Stanford in Silicon Valley to Las Vegas, 
and a piloted drive through the heavy city traffic of Shanghai. Audi 
will offer piloted driving for the first time in the next generation of 
the Audi A8. 
Driver assistance systems and automated driving functions are 
also on the increase in heavy commercial vehicles. 
MAN and Scania 
are already working on intelligent systems that go beyond cruise 
control and Lane Assist. As in the passenger cars area, Traffic Jam 
Assist will use automation to drive the truck through a traffic jam at 
a speed of up to 50 km/h, thus relieving the driver of monotonous 
tasks such as starting up the vehicle and braking.  
A further variant of the automated and networked approach is 
driving in a convoy, also referred to as platooning. The first vehicle 
of the platoon chooses the lane and sets the pace; the following 
vehicles each drive in the slipstream of the vehicle in front and, 
thanks to the reduced wind resistance, can reduce their fuel con-
sumption and correspondingly the CO
2 emissions. While platooning, 
all of the vehicles are connected to each other via a wireless LAN 
network and constantly exchange data such as 
GPS position, engine 
speed, speed, steering angle and the positions of the brake and 
accelerator pedals. If the driver in front accelerates, the other 
drivers do too. If the front vehicle brakes, the vehicles behind brake 
too. Platooning ensures a consistent flow of traffic for the 
commercial vehicles involved. Utilization of the road can be 
significantly improved by this. Scania is also further developing 
these technologies into driverless trucks for mining uses. 
Corresponding prototypes are already in use in closed off areas. 
Emergency brake assist has been a mandatory equipment 
requirement for new registrations for most types of commercial 
vehicles since November 2015. Already during the reporting period, 
MAN introduced the newest generation of emergency brake 
assistance with sensor fusion – the interaction of radar sensor and 
front camera – and the emergency brake signal. The braking 
performance required by law for 2018 has thus already been 
exceeded. The respective 
MAN and Scania vehicles not only have 
emergency brake assistance, but also Lane Assist as standard.  Studies and concept vehicles pave the way to the future 
At the Geneva Motor Show 2015 the Sport Coupé Concept  GTE 
study was among the highlights of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars 
brand. With its breathtakingly dynamic silhouette, the four-door 
coupé offers a glimpse into the brand’s progressive new design 
language. Driven by a plug-in hybrid system consisting of a V6 
TSI 
powertrain and two electric motors, the Sport Coupé Concept 
GTE 
achieves a top speed of 250 km/h. 
The Audi prologue Avant study was also presented in Geneva: 
With a successful synthesis of dynamics, form and function, it 
reinterprets the brand’s Avant philosophy. The five-door vehicle is 
positioned in the luxury class with a pioneering body concept, 
characterized by an elongated roof, a very flat D-pillar as well as a 
broad and flat front end. The prologue Avant is also powered by an 
innovative plug-in hybrid drive. 
The Audi e-tron quattro concept 
SUV show car – presented at 
the 
IAA 2015 – has three electric motors and, thanks to the latest 
battery technology, optimal integration of the battery and excellent 
aerodynamics, can cover more than 500 km on a single battery 
charge. 
Porsche showed the future of the electric sports car in 2015 
with the Mission E concept car. The four-door car with four-wheel 
drive features an emotional design and offers the familiar Porsche 
driving dynamics. The Mission E has a range of more than 500 km. 
Thanks to Porsche’s innovative Turbo Charging system with system 
voltage of 800 volts, recharging the battery barely takes longer than 
a typical refueling stop today: The car can cover approximately 80% 
of its full range after about 15 minutes at a high-speed charging 
station. 
Bentley introduced the 
EXP 10 Speed 6 show car in the year 
under review. This high performance two-seat sports car with 
muscular bodywork and athletic style combines the luxury brand’s 
strengths: advanced technology, motorsport 
DNA and the finest 
handcrafting. With its hybrid drive system, the 
EXP 10 Speed 6 was 
able to set new standards in its class and contribute toward 
expanding the Bentley model range. 
Leveraging synergies increases efficiency 
Our Technical Development department worked intensively on 
leveraging further synergies between the brands in fiscal year 2015. 
The focus here was on the efficient use of resources in developing 
new technologies, with the goal of ensuring the Group’s long-term 
competitiveness. In development centers the brands work together 
on core technologies and form Group-wide expertise networks for 
addressing future topics. The goal is to stake out high-potential 
fields of technology and safeguard the long-term future of the Group 
this way. Moreover, the individual brands are increasingly making 
use of the modular toolkits; this makes synergies possible both 
between models of the same series and across model series. The

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement 
139 initiative to improve cross-brand cooperation in development 
processes was continued and stepped up in 2015 to achieve greater 
increases in efficiency in methodology and system development in 
the future. The brands benefit here from an intensified exchange of 
best practice approaches, e.g. in virtual development. Furthermore, 
IT costs are to be reduced through the joint development of IT tools.  
We are jointly developing transmissions, axles, selected cab 
components and driver assistance systems for mid-size and heavy 
commercial vehicles from Scania and 
MAN. Volkswagen Truck & 
Bus GmbH manages new developments in cooperation with the 
brands. The joint components form the basis for brand-specific 
solutions. In the long-term, joint development is focusing on the 
overall powertrain as a truck’s most important cost driver. 
Pooling strengths with strategic alliances  
In the research and further development of the high-voltage battery 
systems for electric and plug-in hybrid drives, we work together 
with experienced battery manufacturers. We continued and inten-
sified these cooperative projects in the reporting period. 
VW-VM 
Forschungsgesellschaft mbH & Co. KG made further progress with 
electric vehicle batteries in 2015. 
Audi will develop the battery for an all-electric 
SUV on the basis 
of powerful cell modules from the Korean suppliers LG Chem and 
Samsung 
SDI. The partners want to invest in cell technology in 
Europe and will supply Audi from their European plants. The new 
technology will give drivers of the Audi 
SUV a range of more than 
500 km. 
In 2015, 
AUDI AG, BMW Group and Daimler AG acquired the 
HERE maps and location services business from Nokia Corporation. 
The move aims to make 
HERE’s products and services available for 
the long term in the form of an open, independent and value-
creating platform for cloud-based maps and mobility services. 
HERE’s digital maps form the basis for the next generation of 
mobility and location services. These are the foundation for new 
assistance systems, all the way through to fully automated driving. 
Highly accurate digital maps are integrated with real-time vehicle 
data to increase road safety and enable innovative products and 
services.  Scheduled to conclude in 2016, we continued our cooperation with 
Daimler AG to produce the Crafter, in the year under review. 
  Integrating external R&D expertise 
In addition to the Group’s own resources, external service providers 
are also important for our development process. In the years ahead, 
they will help us to systematically advance our model rollout and to 
successfully complete projects with the quality we expect but in less 
time. The use of development service providers is being increas-
ingly coordinated between the Group brands in order to also 
achieve economies of scale here. We are also constantly expanding 
our cooperation with subsequent series suppliers in order to be 
able to tap into their expertise in the development phase of modules 
and components, including at international development sites. 
 
Numerous patents filed 
In fiscal year 2015, we filed 6,244 (6,198) patent applications world-
wide for employee inventions, more than half of them in Germany. 
The growth in comparison with the previous year results in 
particular from the increased number of applications relating to 
driver assistance systems, conventional and alternative drive 
systems and lightweight construction, and once again pays testa-
ment to the Company’s high innovative strength. 
 
Key R&D figures 
The Automotive Division’s total research and development costs 
were up 3.8% year-on-year in the reporting period. Along with the 
new models, the main focus was on the electrification of our vehicle 
portfolio, a more efficient range of engines, lightweight construc-
tion, digitalization and the development of toolkits. The capitali-
zation ratio rose to 36.9 (35.1)%. Research and development costs 
recognized in the income statement in accordance with 
IFRSs 
increased to €11.9 (11.5) billion. This meant that their ratio to sales 
revenue in the Automotive Division amounted to 6.4 (6.5)%. 
As of the end of 2015, the Research and Development function 
– including the equity-accounted Chinese joint ventures – employed 
48,731 people Group-wide (+6.5%), corresponding to 8.0% of the 
total headcount.

171," The Volkswagen  
Commercial Vehicles Group
The Customer is at the heart of all activities
Volkswagen reorganized its commercial vehicles business in 
2015. The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles group comprises the 
business with light as well as mid-sized and heavy commercial 
vehicles. The activities of 
MAN Truck & Bus, MAN Latin America – 
whose unit sales are essentially the responsibility of Volkswagen 
Caminhões e Ônibus – and Scania have been combined in 
Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH so as to cater to the specific inter-
ests and needs of commercial vehicle customers in the best possi-
ble

 
manner.
The business with trucks, buses, and transporters differs 
fun-damentally from the passenger car business. Commercial 
vehicles are capital goods: they are purchased in order to earn 
money with them. Customers are consequently very cost-con-
scious. A truck covers around two million kilometers in the course 
of its useful life. Therefore, it is not just the purchase cost that plays 
a key role in the decision to buy. The lower a vehicle’s fuel consump-
tion and the more efficiently the service, maintenance and repairs 
are carried out, the greater the customer’s profit margin. For this 
reason, the total operating costs, i.e. the costs during the vehicle’s 
entire

 
useful
 
life,
 
are
 
the
 
key
 
metric
 
for
 
the
 
investment
 
decision.  
Other key factors for the customer include the reliability and 
availability of a commercial vehicle: a truck or bus only earns mon-
ey when it is on the road. Volkswagen’s commercial vehicles brands 
offer services especially geared to customer requirements in order 
to optimize the vehicles’ operating times. Examples of the strong 
focus on customers, who are businesses just like ourselves, include 
the lease of trucks and trailers, the provision of replacement vehi-
cles, services geared to working times, service contracts specifi-
cally tailored to customer needs, and telematic services, but also 
training

 
the
 
drivers. 
The global truck and bus markets are shaped by different cus-
tomer needs. For this reason, there is no one “standard vehicle” for 
worldwide use. Trucks and buses need to be individually adapted to 
different customer specifications and regional conditions. For ex-
ample, freight forwarders in India have different robustness and 
cross-country-mobility requirements for the vehicle than those operating their vehicle fleets in Europe. The challenge is never-
theless to design as many of the vehicle’s components as possible 
for
 
use
 
worldwide
 
through
 
smart
 
design.
Tractor for semitrailer, gravel tipper, fire truck, furniture van, 
gritting vehicle, cement truck, delivery van, refrigerated truck, or 
tradesman’s van – the range of possible uses of commercial vehi-
cles and thus their possible configurations are almost unlimited 
and many times greater than for passenger cars; however, the pro-
duction volume is significantly lower. Close cooperation with the 
bodybuilders is therefore highly important when we need to real-
ize

 
the
 
optimum
 
vehicle
 
solution
 
for
 
our
 
customers.
The business with city buses, intercity buses, coaches and 
small buses is also highly complex. Modern city bus concepts – for 
example based on a hybrid or electric drive – will play a part today 
and in the future in saving the world’s ever increasing high-densi-
ty urban areas from gridlock. Long-distance buses are already 
used in many regions of the world as a very environmentally 
friend
ly means of transport that is inexpensive for passengers. 
This

 
market
 
is
 
also
 
gaining
 
significance
 
in
  Europe.  
The market for capital goods, which commercial vehicles are 
part of, is very cyclical. In an economic upturn, the need for trans-
port and thus the demand rises sharply, whereas in economically 
difficult times demand falls just as sharply. The production fluctu-
ations arising as a result require a high degree of flexibility from 
manufacturers.  
Global demand for commercial vehicles is expected to rise in 
the next few years. At the same time, the requirements placed on 
commercial vehicle manufacturers keep increasing. Emissions 
laws, safety regulations, and tax and toll models require a high 
degree of innovation and lead to technically highly developed and 
complex products. Furthermore, commercial vehicle manufactur-
ers are increasingly evolving from pure vehicle suppliers into pro-
viders

 
of
 
tailored
 
logistics
 
services.  
The key performance parameters for manufacturers are the 
enhancement of alternative drive systems and fuels and customer-
centric connectivity features. For example, Scania has already 
140
 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT  


The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles group",,,,,,,,,,
172,"handed more than 160,000 networked trucks over to customers. 
Subject to the operator’s consent, the vehicles transmit informa-
tion about their position and their operating status such as fuel 
consumption and driving behavior at short intervals. This infor-
mation provides additional efficiency and safety for our customers 
and enables the manufacturers to expand their business model 
and thus achieve greater independence from economic cycles. We 
will tackle these challenges with individual solutions based on 
common

 platforms. 
Increasingly strict emissions regulations, the customer’s de-
sire to save fuel and the interest in alternative drive systems are 
becoming an increasing focus. For example, natural gas is used as 
an economical and clean drive system for city buses from 
MAN and 
Scania. To be able to use natural gas engines for long-distance 
trucks and buses, however, 
LNG (liquefied natural gas) is required 
instead of 
CNG (compressed natural gas) because this is the only 
way to achieve the necessary energy density and thus the desired 
range. Better infrastructure is needed for natural gas to be widely 
used as a fuel. For instance, fuel station networks have only been 
sufficiently developed in a few countries. Hybrid vehicles offer 
savings of up to 20% of the fuel in distribution transport. Consid-
erable potential is also becoming apparent in long-distance trans-
port,

 
where
 
savings
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
8%
 
are
 
possible. 
A fully electric drivetrain is currently not practical due to the 
still high weight of the battery and the associated decrease in the 
payload in long-distance transport; in distribution transport we 
are currently testing the e-Caddy in the light commercial vehicles 
segment – the e-load up! is already available. Trials are also being 
run for mid-sized trucks. Hybrid solutions make sense in city bus-
es due to the stop-and-go traffic. 
MAN, for example, introduced 
the full hybrid bus Lion’s City Hybrid back in 2010. Both 
MAN and 
Scania are currently developing zero-emissions fully electric city 
buses.  
The Volkswagen Group’s commercial vehicles brands are not 
only working on increasing efficiency and environmental compat-
ibility, but are also intensively developing new driver assistance systems to improve safety. Existing systems such as the emergency 
braking system and the lane assist system are being continuously 
improved. Further opportunities for safe driving arise from con-
nectivity,
 
for
 
example
 
in
 
the
 
field
 
of
 
car-to-car
 
communication.
Cross-brand management of the commercial vehicles busi-
ness field is part of the organizational structure at Volkswagen 
Truck
 & Bus GmbH. A matrix structure guarantees that our strong 
brands continue to be able to act independently and optimally 
serve their respective customer groups. At the same time, it ensures 
that economies of scale and synergies are achieved through coop-
eration

 
in
 
purchasing,
 
production
 
and
 development.  
The strategic objective is clear: Volkswagen Truck
 & Bus is 
aiming to become a Global Champion. For us, however, it is not the 
sales volume that has priority, but profitability, practical innova-
tions and the expansion of our global presence. The customer is 
always

 
at
 
the
 
heart
 
of
 
all
 
activities.
In order to achieve these objectives, the brands will work  
to
gether on new business models and massively advance digitali-
zation in the commercial vehicles business. In addition, a platform 
strategy is planned for mid-sized and heavy commercial vehicles 
in the future. Common platforms for gearboxes, axles, selected 
cab components and driver assistance systems for trucks and bus-
es are currently in development. In the long-term, the focus is on 
the overall powertrain as a truck’s most important cost driver. In 
view of the long product lifecycles, it will be ten to fifteen years be-
fore the potential arising from this is fully exploited. The common 
components will be the platform for creating brand-specific solu-
tions, although the brands will remain easy to differentiate for the 
customer. By combining activities within Volkswagen Truck
 & Bus, 
we estimate long-term additional synergy potential of at least €650 
million

 
on
 
average. 
There will also be synergies within light commercial vehicles. 
From a technical perspective, these vehicles are more closely related 
to the passenger car and bring developments in connectivity and 
driver assistance systems to our customers who use their vehicle 
commercially.

142  PROCUREMENT In 2015 the focus of procurement was essentially on safeguarding 
the provision of our needs, safeguarding vehicle start-ups and 
opening up new procurement markets for the best possible 
implementation of the procurement strategy in a targeted way and 
implementing our “Volkswagen 
FAST” initiative.  
 
Procurement strategy 
We are working systematically to further optimize the Volkswagen 
procurement organization and build on our abilities and strengths 
together with our suppliers. Our objective is to have the most com-
petitive and highest performing procurement organization. This is 
underpinned by the four strategic procurement targets derived 
from the Group strategy’s corporate goals and the global trends of 
our procurement markets: firstly, to actively shape technical and 
environmental innovation processes and thus to provide market-
centric top quality and innovations at competitive conditions; 
secondly, to meet all cost targets in order to ensure the profitability 
of our products over their entire lifecycle; thirdly, to safeguard the 
global procurement volume through the permanent availability and 
consistently high quality of procured components and guarantee a 
stable and efficient movement of goods; fourthly, to further 
increase the attractiveness of the business area of procurement and 
the satisfaction of our employees by creating optimal working con-
ditions. 
Organizational structures were created in the brands to 
establish defined processes and new methods. There are specific 
work packages and contacts at all management levels. We regularly 
report and review the implementation status of the measures 
agreed. For example, we ensure that the changes initiated contrib-
ute to reaching and permanently establishing our goals. 
Volkswagen FAST – Future Automotive Supply Tracks 
FAST is the central initiative of Group procurement for developing 
the Volkswagen Group and its supply network in a future proof way 
within the framework of Future Tracks. The goal of 
FAST is to 
successfully implement the key topics of innovation and globali-
zation through involving suppliers earlier and more intensively. We 
will work even more closely and quickly with our most important 
partners in the 
FAST initiative. In addition, some processes in the 
field of innovation and globalization that are available to all sup-
pliers will be revised as part of the program. After the start of the 
program at the beginning of 2015, the suppliers who had an 
excellent record in their field of expertise were selected in a 
systematic and standardized qualification process. Global strategies 
and technological focuses are coordinated even more closely with 
these partners, with the common goal of making impressive  
 technologies available to our customers even faster and imple-
menting worldwide vehicle projects more effectively and efficiently.  
We continuously review these strategic partnerships and 
change who is included among our  FAST suppliers as required. For 
example, suppliers not previously selected continue to have the 
opportunity to qualify for the initiative.  
Procurement’s process optimization program 
Since the end of 2015, almost all the Group’s brands and com-
panies have been working within procurement with uniform and 
fully digital processes. In 2014, we began including external 
partners in our digital networks. They can access our systems at any 
time to receive the necessary and updated information. The goal is 
to connect a global standardized digital network of all procure-
ment’s work processes with suppliers within the next four to five 
years. In order to optimize and completely digitalize points of 
contact in the work with our suppliers, the “Supplier Interaction 
Management” program was created.  
 
Supply situation for procured components and raw materials 
Because component standardization within the Volkswagen Group 
is increasing, the importance of global safeguarding of procured 
component capacities increased further in 2015. Procurement’s 
demand capacity management was again able to successfully 
manage all critical incidents and supply bottlenecks, for example 
brought about by production problems, fires, or natural disasters, 
through close, digitally supported cooperation with the suppliers in 
the year under review. We are driving forward digital networking, 
which has already reached a high level, with the latest technologies. 
As a consequence of the economic slowdown in China, the 
global economy lost some of its momentum in the reporting period. 
In 2015, the commodity markets showed high sensitivity to political 
uncertainties. This contributed to the prices for many raw and input 
materials, such as crude oil, steel and rare earths, moving sideways 
or downwards. 
The reporting period was dominated by political tensions, 
particularly in Russia and Ukraine, and by the depreciation of the 
euro. As a consequence, we were only able to benefit to a limited 
extent from the downward movement of commodities traded in 
dollars. Thanks to the use of procurement strategies individually 
adjusted to the commodity markets, it was possible to minimize 
risks arising from volatile commodity prices.  
Digitalization of supply 
The Group Business Platform as the central interface between the 
Volkswagen Group and its partners forms the basis for the digital 
network of the future. Our external partners have the opportunity to  
 
  ",,,,,,,,,,
174,"  
  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement 
143 access the business areas’ systems and process knowledge centrally 
via the Group Business Platform. Every supplier, at the same time as 
employees in procurement, has the same view of the current supply 
situation regarding its parts. This is the basis for the global coor-
dinated work for safeguarding supply in a dynamic network. This 
network is thus able to react to every external influence in every part 
of the world at the same time.  
Procured component management and supplier management 
assure quality within the supply process 
Procured component management, as the technical area of pro-
curement, employs tool and process experts who safeguard new 
vehicle start-ups and aggregate projects worldwide in terms of both 
prevention and response. In addition, the experts safeguard series 
production. In line with the Group-wide growth strategy, procured 
component management is focusing in particular on knowledge 
transfer at the start of global projects. Procured component manage-
ment is globally networked. This means that synergy effects can be 
achieved in both production and process optimization at suppliers. 
In the “Quality in Growth” program, procurement focuses on safe-
guarding start-ups and on managing the subcontractor structure. 
The ever-growing requirements placed on suppliers to be ready 
for the start of production will lead to a stronger focus in particular 
on the suppliers’ industrialization processes as part of a continuous 
further development of the organization.  
In order to safeguard our vehicle start-ups, further perfor-
mance tests across all business areas are carried out at suppliers at 
various milestones of the product development process in addition 
to “two-days production”. As a result, risks for vehicle start-ups can 
be recognized even earlier in terms of production and quality and 
appropriate countermeasures can be initiated. 
In some production plants, start-up experts are additionally 
employed to further strengthen the local project organization and 
implement projects even more efficiently.  
Developing new procurement markets 
Procurement is organized globally and with its presence in 39 
locations across 23 countries ensures that the production facilities 
are sustainably supplied with production materials in the required 
quality and quantity at competitive conditions. Access to relevant 
and inexpensive procurement markets is thus also guaranteed 
against a background of increasing globalization. 
Establishing local supply streams is a core element of our 
growth strategy. Low logistics costs, purchase prices in line with the 
market, import duties levied and independence from fluctuating 
exchange rates all strengthen competitiveness. At the same time, 
people in the regions benefit. We create skilled jobs and contribute 
to economic development by attracting supplier businesses to the 
area around our production locations. In Pune in India, for example, 69 new supplier businesses were 
founded and thus around 13,500 direct and indirect jobs created. 
Thanks to the sustainable development of partners at the Kaluga 
site, the plant there can now draw on more than 60 local suppliers 
for the models produced. 
In addition to established sources of supply, the number of 
qualified suppliers and also suppliers able to export in the growth 
regions is increasing. Experience working with local suppliers will 
be carried over into new projects via the regional procurement 
organization. What is more, specially focused and cross-business-
area project teams work in the emerging and inexpensive 
procurement markets on gradually increasing the export share of 
qualified local suppliers. We are thus increasing the size of our 
global supplier base and exploiting the relevant cost advantages.  
Thanks to these approaches, procurement is able to marshal a 
reliable supplier base for new locations quickly and efficiently.  Sustainability in supplier relationships 
In 2015, we continuously worked on the “sustainability in supplier 
relationships” concept across all brands and regions. The focus 
here was on expanding our third-party audit program for suppliers. 
We audited a total of 26 suppliers in the reporting period with our 
external partners. 
After a walk-through of the results, action plans were developed 
jointly with suppliers where necessary, implementation of and 
compliance with which has been checked. Environmental and 
working conditions could thus be improved with the suppliers 
concerned and risks minimized. 
In addition, in the reporting period we trained both our own 
employees and our suppliers on the topic of “sustainability in sup-
plier relationships”. Over 1,900 new employees received training 
and had their awareness of the issue raised in training sessions.  
In addition, as of December 31, 2015, over 19,500 of our 
suppliers have completed an e-learning module on sustainability on 
our Group Business Platform. This program is supplemented by 
classroom training, which in 2015 also took place in some cases in 
cooperation with other automotive manufacturers in India and 
South Africa. Our business partners provide us with information on 
their sustainability status. In addition to the already established 
questionnaire on the Group Business Platform, which had been 
completed by over 18,000 of our suppliers as of December 31, 2015, 
we began to introduce a new, more comprehensive questionnaire 
in 2015. We make this questionnaire, which was developed jointly 
with other automotive manufacturers, available to our suppliers on 
an external online platform.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement 
144  Our actions are guided by the “Volkswagen requirements for 
sustainability in relations with business partners (Code of Conduct 
for Business Partners)”. If we discover that individual suppliers may 
not be complying with these requirements, a Group office initiates 
improvement measures in dialog with the supplier in question. The 
aim is to implement these improvements as part of a dialog in the 
spirit of partnership. For example, the “sustainability in supplier 
relationships” concept helps us to create the necessary conditions for fulfilling our sustainability standards together with our business 
partners and to secure volume flows for the long term. 
 
Volkswagen Group purchasing volume 
Volkswagen Group procurement mainly purchases production 
materials, services and capex centrally. The volume procured in the

145 PRODUCTION In fiscal year 2015, the Volkswagen Group’s global production 
volume passed the ten-million mark again. Productivity increased 
by 3.5% year-on-year despite the continuing difficult conditions in 
many markets. The rising unit sales figures in Germany and 
Western Europe and the systematic implementation of the Group 
production system compensated for the decreasing volumes in the 
South American and Russian markets. 
 
“Production 2018” strategy 
The vision of our “Production 2018” strategy is to build the world’s 
most powerful and most fascinating automotive production system. 
To make this a reality, we have defined four core objectives: in all 
Group brands and all regions, a systematic effort was made in fiscal 
year 2015 to excite our customers, lift the earnings contribution, 
structure production capacities in line with the market and make 
production more attractive to employees. 
In order to achieve the objectives set, we defined a total of 13 
challenges and continuously worked on these. The challenges 
represent the key action areas in Production, such as the imple-
mentation of the modular toolkit strategy and the expansion of the 
global production network, and are backed up with concrete 
actions. Responsibility for their implementation has been assigned 
to Board of Management and executive management sponsorships 
as well as project teams from all brands and regions. In order to 
identify a possible need for expansion or adaptation to meet these 
challenges at an early stage, key future trends and their impact were 
discussed. The results are incorporated into the strategy work. 
Production locations 
The Group’s latest location in China, the vehicle plant in Changsha, 
came on stream in May 2015. The Volkswagen Group’s global 
production network thus had 119 locations at the end of the 
reporting period, of which 69 were passenger car, commercial 
vehicle and motorcycle locations and 50 were powertrain and 
component locations. 
With 71 locations, Europe remains our most important pro-
duction region for vehicle and component production; 28 of these 
sites are located in Germany alone. The Asia-Pacific region is playing 
an increasingly important role, with 31 locations. The number of  
  production sites in North America (four) and South America (nine) 
remained unchanged in the reporting period. The Group operates 
four locations in Africa. 
In Europe, a new plant for the Volkswagen Commercial Vehi-
cles brand in Wrzesnia, Poland, has been under construction since 
the end of 2014, in addition to the existing plant in Poznan. 
Production of the Crafter will begin there in the second half of 2016, 
with an annual capacity of 100,000 vehicles.  
In order to secure and expand our market position in China, a 
new vehicle plant in Changsha with an annual capacity of 300,000 
vehicles was inaugurated in May 2015. Furthermore, the capacity at 
the Chengdu location is being expanded by 150,000 vehicles by 
2016. The new Ningbo II vehicle plant with a capacity of 150,000 
vehicles per year will be opened at the end of 2017. 
Moreover, in Mexico the Audi brand’s San José Chiapa plant, 
which will have a capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year, will start 
production in mid-2016. In the US market, the product range will 
be supplemented from the end of 2016 by the new midsize  SUV 
produced in Volkswagen’s Chattanooga plant. In addition, the long 
wheelbase Tiguan is to be produced for the US market in the North 
America region from 2017. 
We are also expanding the production network in the engine 
business area. The Györ and Zuffenhausen engine plants are cur-
rently being set up for the new V6 and V8 petrol engines for cross-
brand use. Production will start in the first half of 2016. 
Capacity utilization of the locations in the Volkswagen Group’s 
production network is further enhanced by supplying them with 
complete knock-down (
CKD) kits for local assembly. 
In 2015, a 
CKD facility was opened at the Curitiba plant in 
Brazil. The Volkswagen Golf and Audi A3 saloon models are manu-
factured there. The pressings and assembly modules are largely 
supplied from the Puebla and Györ locations. 
A new licensed production facility was opened in Nigeria, West 
Africa, in July 2015. The assembly is operated by our partner, the 
Stallion Group. It produces models for the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brand. Volkswagen is 
thus increasing its involvement in sub-Saharan Africa. 
We are continuously investigating the possibility of further 
production locations in new markets. ",,,,,,,,,,

New start-ups and production milestones 
In 2015, the Volkswagen Group implemented a total of 59 vehicle 
production starts in 27 locations across 14 countries; of these, 25 
are new or successor product start-ups, while the other 34 start-ups 
were attributable to derivatives and product upgrades. 
A significant event for the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand 
was the start of production of the Touran replacement in Wolfsburg, 
which was launched in September. In April and May, there was a 
generation change for two models at once at Volkswagen Commer-
cial Vehicles at the Hanover and Poznan locations with the start-up 
of the T6 and the new Caddy. Production of the new A4 family began 
at Audi in May, initially with the saloon in Ingolstadt. This was 
followed by the A4 Avant in August and the start of production of the 
saloon in Neckarsulm in October. Production of the 
ŠKODA brand’s 
new Superb began in Kvasiny in March and production of the 
Combi began in June. In November, Bentley launched the Bentayga, 
thus adding an 
SUV to its product range. The SEAT brand’s whole 
Ibiza family received a product upgrade, as did the Porsche 911. 
In addition to the numerous new production start-ups, the 
range of models with alternative drive systems was expanded 
through the addition of the natural gas-driven Caddy and the plug-
in hybrid versions of the Q7 and Passat. Furthermore, production of 
the current models’ replacement products was started at the 
assembly locations in Malaysia, India and Russia. 
At the engine and transmission plants, there was a large 
number of start-ups of new and more efficient powertrains in 2015, 
which also contributed to the expansion of local production  facilities. For example, a new engine plant was opened in Kaluga, 
Russia, in summer 2015. The plant, which has an annual capacity 
of 150,000 units, manufactures the 1.6 liter EA 211 engine, which 
has been adapted to the market, for local supply of the Russian 
vehicle plants in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod. Volkswagen is thus 
expanding its industrial presence in Russia and fulfilling legal 
requirements for local value added. In São Carlos, Brazil, 
production of three- and four-cylinder  TSI engines in the EA 211 
series was started at the engine plant at this site. In the medium to 
long term, they will replace the previous generation produced there. 
In addition, the new W12 petrol engine for use in the new Bentley 
Bentayga has been produced at the Crewe location in the United 
Kingdom since the end of 2015. 
The Volkswagen Group celebrated some important production 
anniversaries in 2015. In South Africa, production of the one 
millionth Polo was celebrated at the beginning of the year. At the 
end of April, the Taubaté location in Brazil celebrated the one 
hundred thousandth up!. The five millionth vehicle on the Group-
wide 
MQB platform rolled off the production line in October. The 
number of these vehicles has thus doubled within a year. At the 
same time, 
ŠKODA produced the brand’s 13 millionth vehicle 
worldwide since joining the Group and the Kassel location 
celebrated production of the one millionth DQ500 dual-clutch 
transmission. In addition, there was a milestone in November, as 
the two millionth Caddy rolled off the production line in Poznan. 
A production anniversary was also celebrated in China in 2015. 
The number of vehicles produced in China (
SVW and FAW-VW) 
exceeded the 25 million mark in November.

147 Flexibility in production 
The modular toolkits allow us to design our production sites to be 
flexible. They generate synergy effects that enable us to reduce 
capital expenditure and make better use of existing capacities. With 
these toolkits we have created the conditions for using the pro-
duction sites for several brands at the same time, and are imple-
menting these systematically in terms of plant capacity utilization. 
For example, the 
ŠKODA Kvasiny location in the Czech Republic will 
also produce a vehicle for the 
SEAT brand starting in 2016. Of the 
40 passenger car locations, 19 are now already multibrand locations. 
Another concept for volume flexibility is the “turntable”. This is 
used, among other things, to compensate for fluctuations in demand 
or in segment shifts. One such “turntable” is formed by Volks-
wagen’s sites in Emden (Passat), Zwickau (Passat and Golf) and 
Wolfsburg (Golf).  
As the complexity of products increases, a factory must work at 
optimal capacity so as to continue manufacturing high-quality pro-
ducts that give customers maximum benefits at competitive prices. 
This is all made possible by the standardization of production 
processes and operating equipment at an early stage. The basis for 
this is consistent construction and design principles that are 
defined in the form of product standards. “Concept consistency” 
ensures that common design principles, joining techniques and 
joining sequences, but also installation and connection concepts, 
are applied in the brands’ development and production areas. The 
principle of concept consistency is a fundamental component of the 
creation of efficient logistics and manufacturing processes. 
 
The Group’s production system 
To help us become the world’s most powerful and most fascinating 
automotive production platform, we optimize and standardize our 
production processes. The Group’s value-driven, synchronous 
production system provides us with the necessary methodologies 
and instruments for this. Our goal is to establish the Group pro-
duction system throughout the world at all brand and regional 
locations so as to achieve sustainable and continuous improvement. 
We have already made substantial progress towards this. In the 
future, we will increase the attention we give to further strength-
ening the Group’s production system and increasing its presence. 
As a first step in this direction we are measuring the extent to which 
the methodologies and instruments are being implemented at the 
locations. The target/actual comparisons are used to identify fields 
of action. These are then defined in a project plan and worked 
through in a structured manner in the second step. As a synchro-
nous company, we are including all business areas so as to system-
atically optimize processes. 
We are creating and managing a global production and logistics 
network in the area of material and vehicle logistics, from the 
  supplier to the assembly line and from the factory to the dealer and 
the customer. Logistics services are planned across all brands from 
a single source, managed and, when required, purchased via the 
“procurement of logistics services”. It is important to us to adhere to 
stable and uniform processes worldwide. 
The Volkswagen Group’s automotive logistics are managed 
across all brands, locations and models. Enduring efficiency is a 
prerequisite for our competitiveness. We meet challenges of the 
Industry 4.0 with holistic optimizations, pioneering innovations, 
flexible supply streams and structures and an agile team.  
Our brands, regions and plants are together designing the 
logistics of tomorrow in a digital automotive world and using new 
technologies. The massive rise in the availability of information is 
making processes from the supplier to the production plant to the 
customer more and more transparent. We use animated planning 
tools for designing factories and supply streams and have already 
implemented the tracking of loaded trucks by  GPS. Our production 
plants work in an automated and digitalized manner with driverless 
transport systems in logistics.  
In all this, the traditional logistics objective still applies: infor-
mation, material and vehicles are to be in the right place at the right 
time in the right quality and quantity – at the optimum cost. 
Environmentally efficient production 
The Volkswagen Group has set itself the goal of reducing the levels 
of the five key environmental indicators of energy and water 
consumption, waste for disposal and CO
2 and VOC emissions in 
production by 25% for each vehicle produced – starting from 2010 
levels – by 2018. This objective applies to all of the Group’s 
production locations, derived from our ecological requirements for 
production processes that are anchored in the Group’s environ-
mental principles. As the charts on page 148 show, we have already 
made considerable progress towards reducing all these key 
indicators.  
The Volkswagen Group’s brands contribute to achieving these 
goals with their own frameworks that reflect the specific features of 
their corporate culture and their brand image. Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles have 
established “Think Blue.Factory”, Audi has its “ultra strategy”, 
ŠKODA calls its program “Green Factory”,  SEAT calls its program 
“
ECOMOTIVE Factory” and Bentley’s program is called 
“Environmental Factory”. Porsche has introduced “resource-
efficient production”. Scania and 
MAN are giving their 
commitment to the environment the names “Blue Rating” and 
“climate strategy”, respectively.  
We are encouraging close integration and communication 
between the brands worldwide in order to create synergies. Our 
environmental experts meet regularly in working groups; in 
addition, they train our employees on the topic of environmental  
   ",,,,,,,,,,

protection. We record and catalog environmental measures in an IT 
system and make these available for a Group-wide exchange of best 
practice. In the reporting period, more than 1,900 implemented 
measures in the area of environment and energy were documented 
in this system. They serve to improve passenger car and light 
commercial vehicle production processes. These activities are 
worthwhile not just from an environmental perspective: they also 
lead to annual savings of around €65.9 million.  
 The following examples from the year under review show the extent 
to which the measures contribute to improvement of the production 
processes and achievement of the target values for the five key 
environmental indicators:  
One important lever for reducing energy consumption is on-
demand operation of all plants. At our Hanover plant, by switching 
from two paint dryers to one load-dependent operation we reduced 
energy requirements by around 8,000 MWh per year; this is equiv-
alent to annual savings of around €200,000 and 1,700 tonnes of CO

149 We use recycling facilities at some of the Group’s locations. These 
process biologically precleaned waste water for reuse through the 
membrane process in order to reduce the consumption of fresh 
water. We brought a recycling facility on stream at the Salzgitter 
location in 2015. This facility processes half the plant’s waste water 
into recycled water and uses it to feed the central cooling tower. As a 
result of this measure, we save around 75,000 m
3
 of freshwater 
there annually; this is equivalent to around a quarter of the loca-
tion’s needs. 
Modernizing part of the smelter at the Hanover location 
enables us to save around €3 million off our annual energy and 
material costs and reduce CO
2 emissions by around 7,000 tonnes 
per year. Reduced oxide formation will additionally cut our use of 
materials by 70% and, as a result, also the amount of waste to 
recycle.  
A new application technology that enables material savings is 
being used in the paintshop at the Spanish location of Martorell. We 
can thus reduce solvent emissions by 80 g per vehicle and make cost 
savings of €951,000 per year. 
We are also reducing our CO
2 emissions through energy recov-
ery, among other things. In 2015, 
MAN set up a heat recovery system 
at the ship engine test facility at its site in Frederikshavn, Denmark. 
In the reporting period, we recovered over 3,160 MWh of thermal 
energy, which we supplied to the municipal district heating system. 
This lowers the CO
2 emissions by 835 tonnes.  
The natural gas-driven combined heat and power plant that 
came on stream in Zwickau in 2014 also makes a contribution to 
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, it generated 36% 
of the energy requirements at the site. By generating our own energy, 
we reduced our CO
2 emissions by around 19,100 tonnes and 
achieved savings of roughly €8.9 million.  
In Pinetown, South Africa, we have installed a photovoltaic 
system covering 6,300 m
2
 and thus created the MAN brand’s first 
climate-neutral location and South Africa’s first carbon-neutral 
production site. With over 300 days of sun a year we are able to 
generate 810 MWh and thus not only completely supply the location, 
but also feed the surplus power into the public electricity grid. 
Green logistics 
Logistics contributes to the Volkswagen Group’s ecological orien-
tation. For example, we analyze the entire transport chain in respect 
of CO
2 emissions. The objective is to avoid transports or to shift to 
more environmentally friendly modes of transport and to reduce 
fuel consumption. We are working on measures and areas of action 
for optimizing the logistics processes across the brands.  
In a system known as logistics process partner management, we 
are improving the pickup processes together with freight 
forwarders and suppliers in terms of cooperation, efficiency and 
capacity utilization in the transport network. An important starting point for reducing CO 2 emissions is the 
selection of the mode of transport. One of the most efficient options 
here is maritime transport. The Volkswagen Group is therefore 
involved in the Clean Shipping Network (
CSN), an association of 
marine cargo owners, and is represented on its management board. 
With the aid of the Clean Shipping Index rating tool, members of 
CSN can compare environmental efficiency figures, for example the 
emissions of individual ships on particular routes. This allows the 
environmental footprint of maritime transport to be analyzed and 
reduced. 
The successful use of alternative drive technologies is of decisive 
importance in environmental and economic terms. E-mobility, gas 
and hybrid drives, fuel cells or other novel fuels offer interesting 
problem-solving approaches that we are examining for future use. 
In maritime transport, for example, the use of liquefied natural gas 
(
LNG) is being examined because neither airborne particles nor 
sulfur oxide (SOx) are emitted. In addition, nitrogen oxide and CO
2 
emissions are reduced.  
The continuous increase in efficiency in container manage-
ment also contributes to reducing emissions. Volkswagen has one of 
Europe’s largest pools of load boards in Europe – for example for 
pallets or containers. The Group’s container management contin-
uously works on improving the packing density, weight and folded 
volume of new load boards and on optimizing the transport routes 
for empty container shipping. In the design and manufacture of 
new load boards, we endeavor to use recyclable materials. As a 
result, plastic small load boards turn completely into recyclates that 
can be reused in new small load boards. 
Last but not least, noise pollution is also taken into account 
when analyzing logistics processes. In 2015, among other things, 
the rail wagons from 
TOUAX were incorporated into the Volkswagen 
rail network. The use of modern technology – especially the 
composite brake pads – allows noise when braking to be reduced by 
more than 75%.  
SALES AND MARKETING 
The Volkswagen Group’s unique product portfolio comprises twelve 
successful brands, including innovative financial services.  
 
Brand diversity in the Volkswagen Group 
At the Volkswagen Passenger Car brand, what the customer wishes 
is always the focus of what we do when it comes to developments 
and decisions. This way we ensure that the automotive innovations 
and solutions that we offer meet the needs of the customers, and are 
at the same time affordable. This is our competitive advantage: 
based on this, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand aims to become 
the most innovative volume manufacturer with the best quality in 
each class in the medium to long term. Against the backdrop of the 
emissions issue, our goal of acting responsibly and at the same time

even greater significance. We at Volkswagen are therefore doing 
everything in our power to restore confidence and to continue to 
convince our customers of German engineering and the reliability 
of the brand. 
“Vorsprung durch Technik” is not just a slogan for Audi; it is an 
active brand promise that is delivered throughout the world, 
making Audi one of the most highly desired brands in the premium 
segment. Its objective is to become the most successful brand in this 
segment. To achieve this, Audi relies heavily on its progressive 
image, high-value products and sporty character. Audi’s innovative 
engineering solutions and emotional design language have won it 
numerous honors and awards.  
Intelligent concepts and a good value proposition have made 
ŠKODA a very successful brand in Europe and China. The “Simply 
Clever” slogan combines forward-looking functionality with an 
impressive space concept that is technically simple but offers 
sophisticated and practical features.  
Design, passion, quality and ongoing evolution – these are the 
distinctive characteristics of the youthful, dynamic Spanish 
SEAT 
brand that is aiming for stronger growth, particularly in Europe. 
SEAT’s goal of combining technological precision and superb engi-
neering with emotional design is expressed in its 
“TECHNOLOGY 
TO ENJOY”
 slogan.  
Sports car manufacturer Porsche’s brand values are a combi-
nation of opposites: exclusivity and acceptance, tradition and inno-
vation, performance and suitability for everyday use, design and 
functionality. Porsche’s philosophy is “to achieve maximum output 
from minimum input”. From the very beginning, Porsche has focused 
on finding intelligent ways to convert performance into speed – and 
success – not just with more horsepower, but also with more ideas. 
Exclusivity, elegance and power – these are the defining quali-
ties of our Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini brands in the luxury 
vehicle segments. They round off the Volkswagen Group’s brand 
diversity in the passenger cars segment. 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles stands for superior mobility 
with its three core values – reliability, economy and partnership. 
The brand offers a range of different transport solutions based on 
the highest levels of engineering. The vehicles are tailored to meet 
the individual transport needs of customers in trade and industry, 
as well as civil authorities and service providers. Private customers 
value the brand’s family-friendly 
MPVs and recreational motor 
homes. 
The Swedish Scania brand’s core values are “customer first”, 
“respect for the individual” and “quality”. This successful company 
has been manufacturing high-performance trucks and buses 
featuring extremely innovative technology for over 100 years. The 
brand offers its customers efficient transport solutions backed by 
excellent service offerings and financial services. Customer focus, enthusiasm for the product and efficiency are the 
core values at  MAN. As well as trucks and buses, the company is a 
leading manufacturer of diesel engines, turbomachinery, turnkey 
power plants and special gear units. 
Ducati is one of the most famous manufacturers of premium 
motorcycles. Its emotionally charged products thrill the Italian 
brand’s customers with their premium quality craftsmanship, 
uncompromising performance and challenging dynamics. 
Volkswagen Financial Services provides the Volkswagen Group’s 
private and business customers with the right products and services 
across all vehicle segments. It is the key to mobility for our custom-
ers around the world. 
Digitalization in Group sales 
In sales too, we use the opportunities that increasing digitalization 
offers. Our actions are guided by a clearly defined strategy that 
allows extensive cooperation between the brands to create the 
greatest possible synergies.  
Digitalization will make a decisive contribution to creating a 
completely new product experience for our customers character-
ized by seamless integration of the customer across all points of  
interaction. In doing so, we open up new options and business 
models – mobility and other services – around the connected vehicle. 
It will increasingly become an integral component of the customer’s 
digital world of experience. We take care to make all processes 
transparent so that customers always retain control of their own data.  
Moreover, we also gear our internal processes and structures to 
the speed of digital innovation. The result is new forms of cooper-
ation, a more intensive relationship with the international start-up 
scene, a consolidation of venture-capital expertise as a form of 
“development support” for innovative ideas and business models, 
and new lean systems and cloud-based IT solutions. 
Customer satisfaction and customer loyalty  
The Volkswagen Group’s sales activities focus consistently on 
turning our customers into even more satisfied customers – this is 
our top priority. With the aid of the digitalization offensive in the 
Group, we are putting even more emphasis on customer require-
ments and service; this offensive will sustainably shape our busi-
ness. 
The Group’s brands regularly ascertain customer satisfaction 
levels, focusing on products and services. They derive new measures 
from the survey results to achieve even greater customer satis-
faction. 
Measured in terms of customer satisfaction with their products, 
the Audi and Porsche brands are among the leaders in the core 
European markets in comparison to other Group brands and their 
competitors. The other brands in the Group also score higher than 
  
  ",,,,,,,,,,

151 competing brands. All Group brands achieve figures at or above the 
level of the competition in customer satisfaction with dealers. 
Customers are loyal to our brands and trust them when we meet, 
or better still exceed their expectations of our products and services. 
The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand, for example, has main-
tained a high level of customer loyalty in its core European markets 
for several years in a row. The loyalty of Audi, Porsche and 
ŠKODA 
customers has likewise kept these brands in the upper rankings in 
comparison with competitors for a number of years. 
As a consequence of the emissions issue, studies showed a 
slight drop in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand image and 
customer satisfaction with the products in the fourth quarter of 
2015. 
The Group sales structure 
The Volkswagen Group’s multibrand structure helps promote the 
independence of its brands. Nevertheless, we use overarching sales 
activities to increase sales volumes and market share, and to 
increase sales efficiency while cutting costs and improving earnings 
contributions.  
In the reporting period we focused particularly on dealer 
profitability: this was achieved firstly with cost-cutting programs 
and secondly by expanding the business volume for each dealer. As 
part of our distribution network strategy, which calls for us to work 
with strong partners and leverage the potential of all business fields, 
but also in light of the difficult economic situation in some countries, 
we optimized the structure of the distribution network. The focus 
was on a close working relationship with dealers and their 
profitability. We use Group companies to manage our wholesale 
business in over 20 markets. A central department makes sales 
activities more transparent and more profitable. It creates syner-
gies between the different brands and is key to us achieving the 
goals of our Strategy 2018. This makes it possible for the remaining 
wholesale companies to learn quickly and efficiently from the 
Group-wide benchmarking process and from the best practices 
adopted by individual companies. A focus for the reporting period 
was optimizing our national sales companies’ logistics costs.  
Fleet customer business  
The business relationships with fleet customers are often of a long-
term nature. This customer group guarantees more stable vehicle 
sales than the private customer segment in a volatile environment. 
The Volkswagen Group has an established base of business fleet 
customers in Germany and the rest of Europe in particular. Our 
extensive product offering enables us to satisfy their individual 
mobility needs from a single source.  
In 2015 the emissions issue led to uncertainty among those 
customers for whom CO
2 figures in particular are decisive purchase 
  reasons. There was no reported impact on new vehicle registrations 
in the fleet customer business in 2015, however.  
  Used car business  
The used car business is our dealer organization’s fourth key source 
of income after the new car, services and parts businesses. We 
ensure the profitability of the used car business by providing 
efficient processes and systems and highly qualified employees, as 
well as clear guidelines and management tools.  
We focus on professional used car management at both the 
wholesale and retail levels. In order to be able to provide a suitable 
range of products and services, we are systematically expanding our 
demand-oriented offering of relatively new used cars. Customer-
centric financial services are the basis for attractive product 
packages in this respect. In addition, we further strengthened our 
autonomous used car brands and rolled them out internationally so 
as to ensure that our offerings also meet our customers’ needs. 
Cross-brand activities enable us to implement internal examples of 
best practice throughout the Group, benefiting from economies of 
scale and leveraging synergies. 
We established and standardized processes especially for used 
cars at all distribution levels, enhanced and increasingly harmo-
nized the underlying IT infrastructure, and introduced uniform 
management performance indicators.  
To ensure long-term success in our used car business, we attach 
considerable importance to stable residual values – in particular in 
light of the emissions issue. We have set up system-based reporting 
functions for this purpose.  
 
After-sales and service 
In after-sales, the timely provision of genuine parts and individual 
service are instrumental in ensuring passenger car customer 
satisfaction. The Volkswagen Group ensures the global supply of 
genuine parts through an after-sales network with over 120 of our 
own warehouses. Our efficient supplier organization enables 
supply of almost all service centers worldwide within 24 hours. Our 
passenger vehicle brands’ genuine parts and the expertise of our 
service centers represent the highest level of quality and ensure the 
safety and value retention of our customers’ vehicles.  
The Volkswagen Group regards itself as a complete provider of 
all parts and services relevant to customers in the after-sales 
business and ensures the worldwide mobility of its customers 
jointly with its partners. The partner businesses offer the entire 
portfolio of services, for example oil and tire changes, inspection, 
maintenance and repair, in all vehicle classes. We are continuously 
expanding our range of tailored services in order to improve conve-
nience for our customers and customer satisfaction. For example, 
express-service offerings and our German and non-German partner

some Group brands’ economy packages, our customers get an 
attractive complete package in line with the vehicle’s age. The 
dialog reception and the safety checks guarantee a comprehensive 
service for vehicles and customers. In the event of a flat tire or an 
accident, the Group brands’ mobility guarantees ensure our 
customers’ mobility and the repair of their vehicles.  
Around the world, our commercial vehicles business also 
stands for products of the highest quality and for customer 
proximity. Fuel efficiency, maintenance and operating costs, the 
residual resale value of vehicles, and the purchase price – these are 
critical buying criteria for our customers, in addition to availability. 
We are continually extending both our after-sales activity and our 
comprehensive service offering, and these play an important role in 
increasing customer satisfaction.  
Scania is adding services to its range of trucks, buses and 
engines that guarantee fuel efficiency, reliability and good vehicle 
availability. Among these are the Scania Rent Truck & Trailer 
service that helps to overcome short-term fleet capacity problems. 
Scania Parts and the Genuine Parts Warranty ensure that most 
replacement parts are available within 24 hours throughout most of 
Europe. Driver behavior is the key factor for operating efficiency, 
service life of tires and parts, as well as traffic safety. Drivers can 
learn to drive more efficiently and safely at the Scania Academy. 
Scania’s workshop service and service contracts offer customers a 
high degree of safety in addition to consistently high quality. 
MAN provides packages with connected services optimally 
geared to customer requirements – under the 
MAN Solutions 
brand – in order to lower the total operating costs of the vehicles. 
These packages include maintenance and repair contracts, for 
example, in conjunction with 
MAN’s proactive maintenance man-
agement service, 
MAN ServiceCare. Active data exchange between 
vehicles, customers and the 
MAN service points is handled via the 
MAN TeleMatics integrated onboard module.  MAN ServiceCare 
enables operators to schedule servicing work at the most suitable 
times, increasing the availability of their vehicles. The 
MAN services 
are available in a strong, global after-sales network with 1,470 
highly qualified service points. In addition to its genuine parts, 
MAN 
also offers professionally prepared reconditioned parts (ecoline) 
and thus enables economically viable repair of the customer’s 
vehicle in the accustomed quality.  
The e-mobility challenge for sales 
The Volkswagen Group’s e-mobility strategy covers the development 
of customer-centric products and business models to complement 
its range of electric vehicles. For example, we provide specific 
solutions in the field of mobile online services for electric vehicle 
  customers or offer the Charge&Fuel card via Volkswagen Financial 
Services AG, combining the functions of a fuel and charge card.  
When selecting products and partners, we take great care to 
obtain the greatest possible customer benefits and generate maxi-
mum synergies for the Group, while, at the same time, reinforcing 
the identity of our brands.  
We also provided additional sales and after-sales services to our 
electric vehicle customers, such as arranging for customer-specific 
charging infrastructure solutions and services. We are further 
expanding skills in retail – geared to the challenges of e-mobility. 
This includes the further transferal of battery repair expertise to the 
individual markets.   QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The quality of our products and services plays a key role in main-
taining customer satisfaction. Customers are particularly satisfied 
and remain loyal when their expectations of a product or service are 
met or even exceeded. Reliability, appeal and service determine 
quality as it is perceived by the customer throughout the entire pro-
duct experience. Our objective is to positively surprise and excite 
our customers in all areas and thus win them over with our 
outstanding quality. We continued to aspire to this objective in 2015. 
At the same time, however, events in the reporting period showed 
us that we have to expand our current understanding of quality: 
going forward, Quality Assurance will focus more intensively than 
before on the compliance of our products.  
As a result of the emissions issue, we will place even greater 
emphasis than in the past on our quality management system. A 
process-driven approach across all business areas will be rein-
forced throughout the Group. Quality management in the Volks-
wagen Group is based on the standard 
ISO 9001: the requirements 
of this standard must be met to obtain the operating license and 
type approval for producing and selling our vehicles. The standard 
was revised in the reporting period; one of the main substantive 
revisions made concerns risk assessments for non-compliant pro-
cesses. To ensure that these and other revisions are uniformly 
implemented throughout the Group, Quality Assurance developed a 
concept in 2015, setting out guidelines, recommendations and tips 
for the quality management consultants for the individual brands, 
and supported them in the process of implementation. 
As a further step, we have reinforced application of the dual 
control principle – mutual support and control between the divi-
sions – and built up further core expertise in quality assurance. This 
includes setting up control mechanisms between Technical Develop-
ment and Quality Assurance, and carrying out checks on the 
compliance of our products. A number of organizational measures 
were taken to establish a process of checks to be carried out by 
several individuals in the approval of powertrains. 
  ",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement 
153 Based on these and other measures, we intend to ensure within the 
scope of Quality Assurance that all legal requirements imposed on 
us as a manufacturer and on our products are met. 
 
Observing regional requirements 
Our customers’ wishes and desires in terms of new vehicle models 
vary in the individual regions of the world. Identifying these specific 
regional factors and prioritizing them is an important task for 
Quality Assurance, so that they can then be reflected in the develop-
ment of new products and the production of established vehicle 
models. Factors such as the available fuel quality, road conditions, 
traffic density, country-specific usage patterns and, last but not least, 
local legislation play a key role in this process. We mainly use 
market studies and customer surveys to capture the region-specific 
customer requirements. 
Product and supplier quality 
In the reporting period, the large number of product start-ups made 
high demands on Quality Assurance. We nevertheless managed to 
maintain the high quality of the previous years. Our suppliers also 
made important contributions to this. We expect them to use 
sustainable practices, as well as to deliver the highest product 
quality and reliability of supply. 
One of our central concerns is to establish innovative tech-
nologies that are installed in new vehicles in the respective markets 
without any complaints. We are therefore placing even greater 
emphasis than before on the topics of software quality and data 
security. Quality Assurance supports and analyzes new vehicle 
projects long before customers experience a new product. We 
consistently aim to make our products even better and even more 
reliable, while at the same time taking as many customer wishes as 
possible into consideration and factoring in regional requirements.  
In addition, Quality Assurance defines high quality targets and 
standards for the Volkswagen Group, and monitors compliance 
with them. It also identifies the cause of any faults and manages the 
process for removing them. In 2015, we continued to standardize 
our fault removal process, so that we can respond even more 
quickly and effectively to any problems in the vehicle. As a result, we 
can increase customer satisfaction, and at the same time reduce 
warranty and ex gratia repair costs. 
Service quality 
We also aim to improve the quality of our service offerings 
worldwide. As in the previous year, we therefore further optimized 
our warranty and ex gratia repair instruments in 2015. As the direct 
interface with our customers, authorized dealers also offered us 
additional opportunities: we are working on identifying any 
problems that may be revealed in the emotional moment of vehicle 
handover at an early stage, and on preventing such problems from 
occurring. One measure taken in this respect is the introduction of  
  “dealer plant teams” – a proven concept that we repeated for the 
launch of the Volkswagen Touran: employees from different work 
areas inspect the quality of the vehicles delivered to the local dealer 
and feed back details of any problems to the manufacturing plant in 
question. 
  Group quality standards 
Whether they are buying a passenger car, commercial vehicle or 
motorcycle, our customers expect perfect quality from all vehicles of 
the Volkswagen Group. So for more than 40 years now, auditors 
have been deployed around the world to carry out an assessment 
from the customer’s perspective of the vehicles ready for delivery. 
We continually revise the quality standards applied for these vehicle 
audits in line with changes in requirements. In 2015, based on the 
guiding principles of precision and perfection, Quality Assurance 
prepared a truck-specific audit in conjunction with the Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles, Scania and 
MAN brands, and trained and 
certified the product auditors accordingly.  
Our products stand out for their precision, perfect workman-
ship and high-quality appeal. Quality Assurance contributes to this 
with instruments such as master jigs and function cubes. This 
testing equipment in use at Volkswagen ensures that we meet the 
high quality requirements imposed on our vehicle construction 
processes. For vehicle interiors and exteriors, Quality Assurance 
assesses the overall appeal, panel gaps, looks and feel, functionality 
and assembly capability. Where necessary, we adjust components 
or make changes to their design. As the importance of appeal 
continues to grow in the truck segment, Quality Assurance ran a 
comprehensive training program in 2015, in cooperation with 
Scania. Employees were given training on how to correctly adjust 
and classify parts.  
EMPLOYEES 
Excellent performance, the success that comes from it and 
participation in its rewards are at the heart of Volkswagen’s human 
resources strategy. Our teams must draw on the specialist knowl-
edge and abilities of every member if they are to perform at their 
peak, create excellent products and ensure our business success. 
As of December 31, 2015, the Volkswagen Group, including the 
Chinese joint ventures, employed 610,076 people, 3.0% more than 
at the end of fiscal year 2014. Significant factors for the increase in 
employees were the expansion of the workforce at our new plants in 
China, Poland and Mexico and the recruitment of specialists, 
particularly in Germany and China. In 2015, the Volkswagen Group 
took a total of 3,698 temporary employees into its core workforce in 
Germany. 
The ratio of Group employees in Germany to those abroad 
remained unchanged in the past year. As of the 2015 reporting date, 
45.7% were employed in Germany.

154  Vocational group qualifications 
Training at Volkswagen is organized systematically on the basis of 
vocational groups. A vocational group includes all employees whose 
work activities are based on similar technical skills and who need 
related expertise in order to perform their job. The skills profiles lay 
down the functional and interdisciplinary skills for each job. On 
this basis, a broad offering of qualifications is available to 
employees. Employees continue to develop throughout their 
working lives and continuously deepen their knowledge. In this 
process, they also learn from more experienced colleagues, who act 
as experts in the vocational group academies – the learning centers 
of the vocational groups – and pass on their knowledge to others. 
 
 
 
 
 
Dual vocational training 
Dual vocational training, where theory and practice are closely 
interwoven, provides the basis for first-class performance that 
meets the Volkswagen Group’s high standards of expertise and 
quality. Vocational education and training are offered based on the 
expertise required within each vocational group. 
Volkswagen has introduced dual vocational training at many of 
the Group’s international locations in the past few years and is 
continuously working on improvements. In 2015, Volkswagen do 
Brasil made preparations for a three-year mechatronics engineer 
training program. The introduction of the program, which follows 
the German standard, is planned for 2016. When planning the 
construction of new factories – such as Audi’s Mexican plant in San 
José de Chiapa – dual training is included in the process right from 
the start. Over three-quarters of all the Group’s vocational trainees 
learn their trade through dual vocational training. As of December 
31, 2015, the Volkswagen Group had trained 18,651 young people 
worldwide in approximately 60 trades and 50 dual study programs. Once a year, Volkswagen honors its highest-achieving vocational 
trainees Group-wide with the “Best Apprentice Award”. In 2015, 12 
young women and 33 young men at a total of 40 Group locations 
received this award for their excellent performance and technical 
expertise. 
Particularly talented young specialists are supported in talent 
groups. The highest-achieving 10% of vocational trainees in each 
graduation year at Volkswagen AG and of the Volkswagen Sachsen 
GmbH’s location in Zwickau are admitted to these two-year 
development and training programs. These programs are aimed 
primarily at promoting the technical excellence and personal 
development of each participant individually.  
After completing their vocational training, young people at the 
start of their career have the opportunity to take part in the “Wander-
jahre” (Years Abroad) program, spending twelve months at one of 
the Group’s international locations. In the reporting period, 38 
Volkswagen Group locations in 17 countries took part in this 
development program, including Porsche AG and Sitech GmbH for 
the first time. In 2015, 59 employees from Germany and 18 from 
nine other countries embarked on their Volkswagen Group Years 
Abroad program.  
The “Volkswagen Group Charter on Vocational Education and 
Training” adopted in June 2015 shows the high value Volkswagen 
places on education and training. The Charter covers basic issues 
such as the selection process for apprentices, the duration and 
quality of vocational education and training, the tools and infra-
structure available for teaching educational content, and the 
transition to post-apprenticeship employment. 
The Volkswagen Group is a pioneer in the modernization of 
vocational education and training and is making preparations in 
good time for the digitalization of the working environment. Experts 
at Volkswagen and the Federal Institute for Vocational Education 
and Training ( BIBB) are working to establish what adjustments 
need to be made to job descriptions and are drafting proposals for a 
forward-looking organization of vocational training – initially in 
Germany and later also internationally. In the reporting period, the 
focus was on developing a joint job profile for maintenance engi-
neers that spells out the changed skill requirements.  
The Volkswagen Group already develops and uses innovative 
methods in vocational education and training. They include the 
development of innovative learning formats in vocational training 
at Volkswagen and mobile learning with tablets, which Audi rolled 
out as a pilot project in 2015, initially at its German locations and 
later also at the international locations in Györ and Brussels.  
Developing university graduates 
Volkswagen uses a differentiated approach to ensure the loyalty of 
its young academic talent, which consists of two elements: the 
Student Talent Bank and the Academic Talent Pool. 
Through the Student Talent Bank, Volkswagen supports partic-
ularly high-achieving students in both functional and interdis-

155 ciplinary areas. The aim here is to persuade former interns to join 
the Company and, by inviting them to specialist lectures, seminars, 
or visits, for example, to give them the best possible preparation for 
entering a profession in the world of Volkswagen.  
Talented young high potentials are added to the Academic 
Talent Pool just before they complete their degree or doctorate. This 
puts selected high potentials on the radar screen at the Company, 
allowing them to be considered for an entry-level position in one of 
the functional areas. 
Volkswagen offers university graduates two structured trainee 
programs for joining the Company: StartUp Direct and StartUp 
Cross. In addition to working in their own department, trainees in 
the StartUp Direct program get a good overview of the Company and 
attend supplementary training seminars over a two-year period. 
University graduates interested in working internationally can take 
part in the 18-month StartUp Cross program. Over this period, they 
get to know Volkswagen through assignments in a variety of 
specialist areas throughout the value chain and, in addition, they 
broaden their knowledge and experience at different Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars locations at home and abroad. Volkswagen took on 
346 trainees under one of the two programs in 2015; around 30% 
of them were women. 
Trainee programs are also offered at the international Group 
locations, such as at 
ŠKODA in the Czech Republic and Scania in 
Sweden. In addition, the Volkswagen Group’s StartUp Europe 
trainee program has offered young engineers from Southern Europe 
an opportunity to gain international work experience since 2012. 
This Volkswagen program is designed to attract international talent 
and was initially targeted at university graduates from Italy, Spain 
and Portugal. Three months at a foreign subsidiary are followed by 
21 months at a Group company in Germany. Participants may be 
offered permanent positions after the two-year program – 22 
promising young engineers were taken on in 2015.
 
Professional development, leadership and management programs  
The Volkswagen Group Academy offers a broad range of quali-
fication routes for specialists. These include personal development 
programs in addition to general professional development pro-
grams and training within the vocational groups. The basic dual 
training principle, which combines learning of theoretical content 
with practical experience, also plays a key role here. 
A large number of the development programs and selection 
processes for executives, master craftsmen and managers have 
already been standardized across the Group. In 2015, the Volks-
wagen Passenger Cars brand in Germany alone offered over 210 
training programs leading to qualifications for executives, master 
craftsmen and managers, as well as assessment centers. 
Internationally, the Volkswagen Group Academy carried out a total 
of around 75 training programs and assessment centers for 
executives, master craftsmen and managers in Argentina, Brazil, 
China, the United Kingdom, India, Ireland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, 
Slovakia, South Africa, the Czech Republic and the 
USA. Professional development at university level 
Within the Volkswagen Group Academy, the AutoUni ensures the 
availability of specialized academic knowledge. The aim is to 
increase the technical quality in Volkswagen’s vocational groups 
and to promote networking among experts. Nine institutes work in 
conjunction with the vocational group academies and partner uni-
versities to design development programs for the Group’s 
vocational group experts. In addition, a wide variety of professional 
development formats are designed in order to disseminate the 
Group’s wealth of internal knowledge as well as that of university 
professors and business specialists, and to generate new academic 
insights. The 2015 offering included professional development 
formats on sustainability, e-mobility and product electrification as 
well as an online course on materials for experts within the Group 
provided in cooperation with Stanford University. 
The AutoUni cooperates with internationally renowned 
universities, institutes and research centers on a variety of research 
projects, dissertations and theses. At the end of 2015, more than 
530 doctoral students were engaged in research at the various 
Volkswagen Group companies in Germany, investigating forward-
looking, Company-related issues. 
Knowledge Campaign on Digitalization 
Business can only remain viable in the long term if it prepares itself 
in good time for new professions, qualifications and working 
methods. In 2015, Volkswagen developed the “Good Work at 
Factory 4.0” concept, which it presented at an international expert 
conference held during the Hanover Trade Fair. At the heart of the 
concept is work that promotes skills and has a positive impact on 
employees’ health in the highly automated factories of the future. 
Volkswagen aims to automate an increasing number of stressful or 
repetitive jobs in the coming years, using in particular cooperating 
lightweight robots. At the same time, we intend to upgrade the 
remaining jobs by enhancing them with complex management and 
maintenance tasks. This concept is also a response to demographic 
change, which will limit the availability of qualified specialized 
labor in the coming years. To facilitate these changes, Volkswagen 
launched the “Knowledge Campaign on Digitalization” in May 2015. 
The campaign is initially aimed at employees of the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars and Commercial Vehicles brands in Germany in 
order to provide them with a basic understanding of digitalization.  
In the first phase, they come into contact with the subject with 
the aid of short films and educational quizzes in the intranet. In the 
second phase, they are able to attend events in the different 
business areas, where they experience the use of new technologies. 
Programs leading to vocation-specific qualifications in 
Volkswagen’s vocational groups are planned for the third phase. 
The cross-brand and international rollout of the Knowledge 
Campaign on Digitalization took place at the end of 2015.

156  Advancement of women, family-friendly HR policies 
For Volkswagen, family-friendly human resources policies are a key 
attribute of an attractive employer. Volkswagen intends to increase 
the proportion of women in the Company in a sustainable way.  
The Group made its first voluntary commitment in 2011 in 
relation to differentiated targets for the proportion of women in the 
workforce. We hire the year’s best graduates in the necessary fields 
and take into account the proportion of female graduates in the 
relevant subject areas. Averaged across all fields of study relevant to 
Volkswagen, the individual ratios produce an overall goal of 30% 
women among the university graduates hired.

Volkswagen aims to attract female students at an early stage: we use 
our Germany-wide Woman Driv
ING Award and the Woman Expe-
rience Day to focus on female engineering and computer science 
students and graduates, so as to recruit them for technical positions 
with us.  
This increased proportion of qualified women joining the 
Company will enable us to steadily lift the proportion of female 
executives in the coming years. To increase the proportion of 
women in management, Volkswagen AG has set itself the following 
target quotas: by the end of 2016, the proportion of women in the 
first management level is to be 9.8%. In the second management 
level, women are to account for 13.3%.  
The Volkswagen Group is aiming to have 30% women at all 
management levels in Germany in the long term. In the reporting 
period, the proportion of women in management positions overall 
rose to 10.3%, compared with 10.2% in the previous year. We are 
encouraging this development with a number of different measures: 
for example, 2015 saw the second group to embark on the cross-
brand Management Mentoring Program, designed to support 
women on the way to management positions, with 63 participants 
from the Volkswagen Group in Germany. In addition, Volkswagen 
  offers the “Compass” program to specifically encourage women 
with high potential in their decision to aim for a career in manage-
ment. In the reporting period, 60 women from Volkswagen AG – as 
well as the companies Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG and Autovision GmbH – took part in this 
program. 
In addition, Volkswagen intends to raise the proportion of 
women among its skilled workers and master-level workers in 
Germany to 10%; in fiscal year 2015, the proportion of women in 
the Volkswagen Group in Germany (without Scania,  MAN and 
Porsche) was 4.7%.  
Volkswagen specifically targets the recruitment of talented 
women, for example by arranging special work experience and 
orientation days for young women, in order to increase the 
proportion of female vocational trainees in the industrial and 
technical area from 22.6% in 2015 to 30%. The aim of these events 
is to give them a taste of training in industrial and technical trades 
and to support them in their career choices. The Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, 
MAN and Volkswagen Financial Services brands have participated 
in the national “Girls’ Day” in Germany for years. In the year under 
review, they offered over 2,000 schoolgirls a behind-the-scenes 
look into careers in the automotive industry. On Technology Day, 
ŠKODA gave 300 schoolgirls the opportunity to get a taste of working 
in technical and scientific vocations by taking part in practical 
exercises. 
Volkswagen has offered participation in the “Lower Saxony 
Technikum” at its locations in Lower Saxony, Germany, since 2012. 
Female high school graduates complete an internship in a specialist 
technical area and attend university lectures parallel to this. Since 
2012, 91% of all participants – a total of 76 women – have opted for 
a technical degree or vocational training. Of these, 16 completed a 
dual course of study at Volkswagen. 
MAN has taken part in the 
Lower Saxony Technikum at its Salzgitter location since 2015. 
In addition to hiring and supporting talented female employees, 
Volkswagen is working continuously to improve its employees’ 
work/life balance. The Group provides a large number of opera-
tional arrangements and options for individuals to balance pro-
fessional and personal requirements. They include flexible part-
time and shift models or teleworking arrangements at Volkswagen 
and Audi or home office working at Porsche. In addition, all brands 
offer programs to ease the transition back into the workforce for 
employees on parental leave. 
Another step toward becoming a family-friendly company is the 
constant expansion of a range of childcare options. The Volkswagen 
Group has had positive experiences with near-site childcare in 
Germany and abroad. In addition to existing establishments, for 
example at Volkswagen Financial Services AG or at the Volkswagen 
Group of America’s Chattanooga location, two near-site daycare 
centers were created in the past year at locations of Volkswagen AG,

one in Hanover and the other in Emden, both in cooperation with 
the local municipalities. There are plans to expand childcare 
options at other locations as well. Childcare is also available during 
school vacations at all the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, 
Porsche, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and 
MAN locations in 
Germany. The number of options on offer has been increasing 
internationally, too: for example, holiday camps for children are 
also offered by Volkswagen in Shanghai, Navarra, Chattanooga and 
in Kaluga. 
 
Performance incentives and bonus arrangements 
Systematically encouraging and recognizing achievements and 
adapting remuneration systems to allow employees to share in the 
Company’s success for the long term are important components of 
our human resources strategy. Universal and uniform criteria for 
skills development and performance evaluation have been in place 
at Volkswagen AG since 2010. These criteria apply to the entire 
workforce – from vocational trainees to senior executives. They are 
underpinned by concrete incentive systems in the remuneration 
structure.  
Volkswagen AG’s employees covered by collective pay 
agreements have a remuneration system that comprises three main 
elements: 
> basic pay in the form of a competitive monthly salary; 
> a performance-related pay component that additionally 
recognizes the achievements of each individual employee; and 
> the right to a bonus arrangement anchored in the collective pay 
agreements. This three-tier remuneration system has proven its worth as a tool 
for the workforce to participate in the Company’s success. It 
contributes to rewarding individual performance while main-
taining competitiveness at the same time. For this reason, it is 
increasingly becoming standard practice in the Group – at Audi and  ŠKODA, as well as at the Volkswagen Group Rus’ location in Kaluga 
and at Volkswagen de México, among other places. 
 
Employee participation  
Codetermination and employee participation are important pillars 
of our human resources strategy. Volkswagen aims to promote high 
levels of technical expertise and a strong team spirit among its 
employees. The Company invests in its people, offers employees 
attractive opportunities for development and promotes a good 
working climate. This includes employees’ opinions, assessments 
and constructive criticism being heard.  
One tool we use to this end throughout the Group is the opinion 
survey, through which employees can actively help shape the 
Company. With this uniform, Group-wide employee survey, we 
regularly gather information about employee satisfaction. To 
fundamentally revise the work climate index, in spring 2015 we 
suspended Group-wide implementation of the tool. In the future, 
change processes that result from the work climate index will be 
even more sustainably implemented. The spotlight in 2015 was 
therefore on implementing the actions identified in the 2014 
opinion survey.

158  The “Volkswagen Way” has been a successful tool for involving 
Volkswagen AG’s workforce in improving the Company’s efficiency 
since 2007. By using it, we aim to both increase competitiveness 
and safeguard employment. A continuous improvement process 
aimed at achieving continuous process and structure optimization 
in the areas of productivity and quality, ergonomics, leadership and 
teamwork helps to ensure these. Again, a particular focus for the 
“Volkswagen Way” in fiscal year 2015 was on optimizing workflows. 
To this end, projects were initiated and implemented across all 
business areas. One example is the standardization and automatic 
creation of correspondence for the human resources department 
with the 
ESCRIBA application system. In addition to the “Volks-
wagen Way”, a uniform Group-wide production system is used for 
all brands during production. 
Employees use their creativity, knowledge and initiative to take 
responsibility for process and product improvement under the 
Ideas Management program. Employees in Germany have sub-
mitted over 2.1 million ideas since 1949 using the former sugges-
tion program and today’s Ideas Management program, saving 
nearly €3.3 billion at the German locations of Volkswagen AG and 
Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH. Ideas Management is an important 
leadership and motivational instrument for line supervisors. It also 
contributes to improving health and safety in the Volkswagen 
workplace and to implementing our targets for reducing energy and 
water consumption, waste, 
VOCs and CO
2 emissions.

 Preventive healthcare and occupational safety  Volkswagen’s holistic healthcare management system extends far 
beyond traditional preventive healthcare and occupational safety; it 
also covers aspects of work organization, ergonomics, prevention, 
integration and rehabilitation, leadership and prospects for all 
individuals. 
The check-ups established as standard at the German locations 
help to maintain and improve employees’ health and performance 
and help keep them fit. It is a free and comprehensive screening for 
all employees. The employees appreciate its high diagnostic quality 
and the follow-up programs. 
Check-ups are now also successfully carried out at almost all 
international locations. Other preventive healthcare programs 
have been brought into line with Group-wide standards. In some 
cases country-specific supplementary examinations, such as 
HIV 
and tuberculosis tests, have been added. 
Healthy eating concepts and a wide variety of sports and leisure 
activities – from the weight loss and healthy eating campaign at 
Volkswagen in South Africa to internal running events at Volks-
wagen Commercial Vehicles in Hanover – complement the holistic 
approach to health management in the Volkswagen Group. In addi-
tion to the check-up, 
ŠKODA introduced a new Healthy Living Week 
in 2015. The extensive offering of different medical check-ups and 
special healthy living programs was very well received among the 
workforce. In recognition of its preventive healthcare and health 
promotion activities, 
ŠKODA received the “Health Promoting Enter-
prise” award from the Czech Ministry of Health. 
In September 2015, 
SEAT became the first company in Spain’s 
automotive sector to be awarded the sought-after “Healthy Company” 
certificate by the Spanish Association for Standardization and 
Certification (
AENOR) in recognition of the high quality of its health 
management system. 
At the same time, Volkswagen makes improvements along the 
entire product development process in order to guarantee that the 
quality of workplaces and the strains on employees that arise as a 
result of production are already taken into account in the planning 
and design stages of vehicle models. This involves using both 
science and practical experience with the aim of combining state-
of-the-art ergonomic workplaces with innovative work processes. 
By using so-called ergo assistants on the production lines, 
employees are given advice and instructions directly at their 
workstations on how they can perform their workflows more 
ergonomically and consequently modify their behavior.

Using the Group occupational safety management system, all Group 
companies covered by it analyzed their occupational safety organi-
zations and processes. The results are available throughout the 
Group in a central database system. A total of seven Group audits 
were conducted in the reporting period. This includes the system-
atic exchange of examples of best practice in the Volkswagen Group. 
 
Social benefits 
Volkswagen AG tops up the benefits provided by social insurance 
institutions, such as sick pay, and supports dependents when an 
employee dies. All Volkswagen AG employees are also insured by a 
group accident insurance policy against accidents resulting in 
death or disability. Volkswagen AG also grants short-term loans to 
employees in exceptional cases of economic hardship.  
Employees in the Group companies in Germany and abroad 
enjoy additional benefits. Depending on the location, these include 
transport and subsistence allowances, affordable housing, monthly 
childcare allowances as well as subsidies towards selected leisure 
activities. Additional preventive healthcare services or 
supplementary pension insurance policies round off this offering 
on a location-specific basis.  
Volkswagen AG and its brand companies and subsidiaries 
operate an occupational pension system, making an important 
contribution to securing their employees’ retirement income. In 
addition to the components funded by the employer, the direct 
pension commitment offers employees the opportunity to provide 
for their own retirement income through deferred compensation.  Direct insurance is another opportunity for employees to provide 
for their own retirement income through deferred compensation. 
Volkswagen AG’s Time Asset is an instrument that gives staff the 
opportunity to retire earlier. Since 1998, employees have been able 
to make contributions from their gross salary and time credits. The 
accumulated Time Asset credits can be used for paid early retire-
ment.   
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT)  
Increasing digitalization and networking, the necessary end-to-end 
support for business processes and the development of new loca-
tions continually pose new challenges to the Group’s IT functions. A 
well-equipped, state-of-the-art infrastructure is essential in order to 
master these challenges.  
Further developing the application landscape at the corporate 
locations, in business processes and in the sales network efficiently 
is just as vital. The IT staff are responsible not only for developing 
the systems at all of the Volkswagen Group’s brands, but also for 
supporting users in technical development, production and sales. 
This is how applications tailored to the exact needs of the users are 
created. 
The growing convergence of production and IT is opening up 
new opportunities. Big data processes allow machine faults to be 
analyzed and action to be taken at an early stage. Big data makes it 
possible to analyze and evaluate data volumes that are too vast and 
too complex to be processed using manual or conventional methods. 
Volkswagen’s factory planners can use the “digital factory” to 
virtually walk through the buildings before the groundbreaking and 
to test out their plans, thus safeguarding product launch.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement 
160  The Group-wide “Fertigungs-, Informations- und Steuerungs-
system” (
FIS – Production, Information and Control System) 
ensures that vehicles are efficiently produced – at the right time and 
with the right equipment – at currently 43 plants worldwide. 
FIS is a 
key success factor for enabling flexible and cross-brand production 
in the global production network. In the past three years, we have 
increased the Group-wide level of IT standardization for managing 
our plants to 84%.  
Volkswagen is addressing the trend towards digitalization in the 
Group’s own IT labs. IT labs are innovation centers where new IT 
solutions are developed in close cooperation between departments, 
research institutions and technology partners. The innovation cen-
ters act as test laboratories for the Group, as advisors on questions 
concerning the future of information technology and as liaison 
offices for start-up companies. 
Data:Lab in Munich is the center of expertise in topics such as 
big data, advanced analytics (process for systematic analysis of data 
in electronic form), machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
The team of data scientists, project managers and technology 
experts is supported by specialists from leading big data companies, 
research institutions and representatives of start-ups. Examples of 
Data:Lab’s successful projects include forecasting customer wishes 
and loyalty and a long-term and all-time forecast on planning of 
spare parts for the Kassel central depot. This power of innovation is 
recognized outside of the Group as well. Thus, since November 
2015 Data:Lab officially bears the title of ""A Place of Excellence in 
the Land of Ideas"". In a nationwide German competition, Data:Lab 
was cited from among over 1,000 research institutes, companies, 
start-ups and associations as the award winner in the Business 
category. The jury warranted its decision by stating that Data:Lab 
gives a convincing answer to the question of what form mobility will 
take in the future. 
Digital:Lab is being opened in Berlin. Among other things, a 
digital mobility platform for the Group will be created there in order 
to be able to provide mobility services such as fuel price agents or 
parking and weather services to the end customer.  
We established Smart.Production:Lab at the Wolfsburg location. 
This operates in the Industry 4.0 environment and is making an 
important contribution towards progressively turning the Volks-
wagen Group’s production plants into smart factories. With 
conscious use of agile methods and ways of working and a start-up 
culture, the lab’s goal is to quickly develop software and hardware 
pilots and prototypes for production and logistics in-house in a 
manner geared to application. The smart logistics watch project is 
one example of an implemented pilot. Based on an idea that arose at 
an internal hackathon (programming competition), a smart watch 
application was developed in the lab in collaboration with the 
department in a short period of time. As a result of this solution, 
logistics employees can be meaningfully supported and the logistics 
process of parts picking can be further optimized.  Strong networking is also advanced within the Group’s IT depart-
ment. Group-wide hackathons or initiatives such as IT pitching days 
(idea competitions) create platforms on which employees can 
develop new ideas and software prototypes together. With internal 
communities such as the Agile Community and the Group Connect 
internal network, we can quickly network experts together across 
the Group. We are establishing these new methods, means and ways 
of working so that the Group’s IT department can respond quickly, 
flexibly and efficiently to constantly changing requirements. 
CodeFEST8 and KIDScraft 1.0 represent the close integration 
between school and university students and the Group’s IT 
department. The programming competition CodeFEST8 was jointly 
organized in 2015 by several of the Group’s brands and was aimed 
at university students studying technical subjects, particularly 
computer science and business information systems. As part of the 
competition, the participants developed software with the theme of 
“mobility of the future” in just 28 hours. Several hundred young 
people took part in the first round, which took place simultaneously 
at eight universities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 
CodeFEST8 was thus the largest programming competition to date 
in the automotive industry. The two best teams from each university 
campus qualified for the finals at CeBIT. At KIDScraft 1.0, the 
Group’s IT summer camp, 150 children from the Wolfsburg region 
carried out research like future IT engineers. The aim of 
KIDScraft 1.0 is to promote young talent over the long term and, in 
particular, get girls interested in IT, as well as to safeguard the 
future of the IT location in Wolfsburg and environs. 
ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE PROTECTION 
Stakeholders’ expectations of our Company are constantly rising, 
particularly with regard to global megatrends such as climate 
change, demand for resources, demographic changes and 
increasing urbanization. We are tackling this challenge and taking 
responsibility. 
Volkswagen has set itself the goal of being the leading auto-
motive company in environmental terms as well. To help us achieve 
this goal, we have bundled our environmental protection activities 
in the Group environmental strategy. 
Our commitment centers on four major subgoals:  
> Number one for resource conservation across the lifecycle  
> We view our products’ environmental footprint holistically across 
their entire lifecycle. Our central concern here is to protect the 
environment and in particular to conserve finite resources. The 
steps we have taken focus on efficient product and process design, 
the use of innovative environmental technologies and sustain-
able energy supplies. 
> A leading manufacturer of environmentally friendly products 
Our products combine state-of-the-art technology, comfort and 
safety, low fuel consumption and lower CO
2 emissions. The long-
term goal is CO
2-free mobility.  
  ",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Sustainable Value Enhancement 
161 > Environmental awareness anchored throughout the Company 
The Volkswagen Group’s employees are the driving force behind 
its environmental strategy. They are well informed, well qualified 
and operate in an ecologically responsible manner. Our great 
strength is that, in exchanging best practice, we pool our 
employees’ knowledge across brands and regions and leverage 
this across the entire Group. 
> Number one for intelligent mobility 
We understand intelligent mobility to mean the challenge of 
offering mobility and comfort and at the same time protecting the 
environment and reducing traffic waste. This requires the 
efficient interplay of people, infrastructure, technologies and 
means of transport. 
The Group environmental strategy is based on a holistic approach 
that is geared to the value chain and thus involves all divisions. We 
have set ambitious, measurable targets in these areas and are 
pursuing them systematically. This includes reducing CO
2 emis-
sions from our European new car fleet and designing each new 
model generation to be more efficient than its predecessor. In 
production, we want to reduce the levels of the five key environ-
mental indicators of energy and water consumption, waste for 
disposal and CO
2 and VOCs emissions by 25% for each vehicle 
produced by 2018, in comparison with 2010.  
We can only reach our ambitious goals if we firmly entrench 
environmentally relevant issues in our organizational and decision-
making processes. The basis for this is our environmental manage-
ment system, which has been in place for many years. The Group’s 
environmental policy is a key component of this. It is based on the 
Group’s environmental principles for our products and production 
that are in force throughout the Company. The Technical Develop-
ment department’s environmental goals are also anchored in the 
environmental management system. We make sure that these pro-
cesses are regularly confirmed by submitting them to certification 
procedures and external audits, including in the reporting period. 
Our energy management system, which has been introduced 
successively into all locations since 2010, has had 
ISO 50001 
certification since 2012. We have taken part in a growing number of 
environmental certification schemes since then, with the result that 
our locations worldwide as well as the Technical Development 
department have certification under 
ISO 14001, and also, since 
2009, under 
ISO/TR 14062. 
The Group-wide entrenchment of environmental protection 
should also be reflected in our employees’ environmental thinking 
and actions. This, however, assumes that they are appropriately 
informed and trained. For this reason, we have appointed environ-
mental management officers around the world, who are working on 
building a broad basis for environmental protection within the 
Group. In order to pool and make use of the expertise and know-
how of all our brands’ and regions’ employees, cross-brand and 
cross-departmental steering committees and work groups take 
place regularly at both management and expert level.  
Volkswagen welcomes the outcome of the UN’s 
COP 21 Climate 
Change Conference that was held in the reporting period. The 
  negotiators agreed an ambitious target of limiting global warming 
to below 2 degrees Celsius. In advance of the conference, Scania 
and Audi had contributed their ideas on low carbon freight and low 
carbon fuel to the  WBCSD’s Low Carbon Technology Partnership 
Initiative. The initiatives develop measures and projects to make the 
planned climate target a reality. 
Biodiversity 
Biodiversity means the variety of life on our planet, and covers the 
variety of species, the genetic differences within species and the 
diversity of ecosystems. We rely on it as the basis for our continued 
existence: healthy food, clean water, fertile soils and a balanced 
climate. Protecting biological diversity is one of the greatest societal 
challenges of our time. The United Nations has therefore declared 
the current decade to be the “UN Decade on Biodiversity”. 
Volkswagen has been committed to protecting biodiversity 
since 2007 and is a founder member of the Biodiversity in Good 
Company e.V. initiative. In our mission statement, we have com-
mitted to supporting the protection of species at all locations. We 
primarily contribute to achieving the targets of the UN Convention 
on Biological Diversity by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
employing materials and resources as efficiently as possible. As a 
consequence of the diesel issue, we are putting our membership of 
the Biodiversity in Good Company e.V. initiative on hold for the time 
being. 
Biodiversity is a component of our environmental management. 
We have, among other things, appointed a biodiversity officer and 
had external expert assessments drawn up on the risks for water, 
the soil and biodiversity for 32 locations of the Volkswagen Passen-
ger Cars, Porsche and 
MAN brands.  
One of the projects we jointly implemented with Naturschutz-
bund Deutschland e.V. (
NABU) was a moor conservation project in 
Germany. 
NABU additionally established an International Moor 
Conservation Fund in 2015 with a donation from Volkswagen 
Financial Services AG. Volkswagen and 
NABU also worked together 
as partners on their joint “Willkommen Wolf!” wolf conservation 
initiative in 2015. Our longstanding cooperation agreement with 
NABU expired as of December 31, 2015. Following suspension of 
the negotiations to extend this agreement as a consequence of the 
diesel issue, we are working hard on achieving the requirements 
for continuing this strategic partnership.  
At our international sites, we support the protection of nature 
and biodiversity with various partners. At the Urumqi location in the 
Chinese province of Xinjiang, we support biodiversity research. 
Since 2011, we have also been supporting the Dyer Island Conser-
vation Trust in South Africa. Together with the Trust, we have been 
involved in the protection of penguins, dolphins, whales, seabirds 
and sharks, and also conduct research, education and training 
programs to strengthen environmental awareness. In the reporting 
period, the Trust opened a sanctuary for seabirds there.  ",,,,,,,,,,

162  External environmental awards 
The Volkswagen Group’s models and its brands received numerous 
awards in 2015, in particular for alternative drive systems. Here are 
some examples: 
AUTO TEST , the monthly consumer advice edition of  AUTO 
BILD
, and ÖKOTREND, the independent environmental research 
institution, presented awards for the most environmentally friendly 
cars in all classes in 2015. Two models of the Volkswagen Passenger 
Cars brand won in their categories: the eco-up! in the small car 
category and the Golf 
GTE in the compact class. The Porsche 
Cayenne S E-Hybrid was voted number one in the 
SUV category. 
Assessment criteria included the manufacturer’s commitment to 
the environment and social responsibility, and the environmental 
impact of the vehicles across their entire lifecycle.  
In 2015, for the third time in a row, the Swiss Transport Club 
(Verkehrs Club Schweiz) gave first place awards in its 2015 environ-
mentally friendly car list to three Volkswagen Group models with 
natural gas-powered drives. The Volkswagen Passenger Cars’ eco-
up! and its counterparts with identical construction from 
SEAT and 
ŠKODA were able to beat the competition due to the moderate level 
of noise they emit and excellent climate protection figures. 
In the 
ADAC EcoTest, the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s 
natural gas vehicles Golf 
TGI BlueMotion and eco-up! and the 
electric vehicle e-up! scored the top rating. The overall result of the 
ADAC EcoTest is composed of various ratings including the testing 
of emissions such as carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen 
oxides and particles in realistic driving cycles – some with the air-
conditioning system turned on.  
In the specialist magazine Car & Driver’s “Ten best 2016” 
competition, 231 models available on the Brazilian market were 
assessed. The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand received the 
highest number of awards. Due to the new 
TSI Total Flex engine 
with 1.0 liter capacity, the specialist jury selected the move up! 
TSI 
as the “most sustainable model” and the speed up! 
TSI as the “best 
hatchback”. The 
TSI Total Flex engine is Volkswagen do Brasil’s 
latest engine. The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand’s Lamando and the  ŠKODA 
Octavia were awarded gold medals in the China Eco-Car Assess-
ment Program. The environmental characteristics of a vehicle  
– including aspects such as interior air quality, noise, potentially 
harmful substances and materials – are systematically and compre-
hensively assessed in the test.  
The e-up! won in the electricity consumption category in the 
environmentally friendly car list of the German Automobile Asso-
ciation, Verkehrsclub Deutschland e.V. (
VCD). The VCD assesses 
more than 400 current passenger car models and aims to give car 
buyers a scientifically based decision-making tool. 
The Green Car of the Year Award from the US specialist maga-
zine Green Car Journal, which we had received for the Volkswagen 
Jetta 
TDI and Audi A3 TDI models in 2009 and 2010, respectively, 
was revoked as a result of the diesel issue.  
REPORT ON POST-BALANCE SHEET DATE EVENTS 
Through its 50% interest in the joint venture Global Mobility 
Holding B.V. (
GMH), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, the Volkswagen 
Group held a 50% indirect stake in the joint venture’s subsidiary, 
LeasePlan Corporation N.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands 
(LeasePlan). LeasePlan is a Dutch financial services group whose 
core business is leasing and fleet management. 
The final approvals for the sale of LeasePlan to an international 
consortium of investors were issued by the competent authorities in 
January 2016. Legal transfer of the LeasePlan shares to the 
consortium was completed on March 21, 2016. 
The total value of the transaction was approximately €3.7 billion 
plus interest in the amount of €31.5 million. In 2016, this had a 
positive effect of €2.2 billion on investing activities and net liquidity 
and, taking into account the disposal of equity-accounted 
investment in 
GMH, resulted in a low three-digit million euro range 
for the Volkswagen Group, which is reported in the financial result. 
On completion of the transaction, the existing credit line of €1.3 
billion provided by the Volkswagen Group was cancelled.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Expected Developments 
163 In the following, we describe the expected development of the 
Volkswagen Group and the general framework for its business 
activities. Risks and opportunities that could represent a departure 
from the forecast trends are presented in the Report on Risks and 
Opportunities. 
Our assumptions are based on current estimates by third-party 
institutions. These include economic research institutes, banks, 
multinational organizations and consulting firms. 
GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
In our plans, we assume that the global economic growth in 2016 
will be level with the previous year. Risks will arise from turbulence 
in the financial markets and structural deficits in individual coun-
tries. In addition, growth prospects continue to be hurt by geo-
political tensions and conflicts. We expect the economic upturn to 
continue in most industrialized nations, with moderate rates of 
expansion overall. As in the previous year, growth will in all 
probability be muted in many emerging markets. We expect the 
strongest rates of expansion in Asia’s emerging economies. 
We anticipate that the global economy will also continue to grow 
in the period 2017 to 2020. 
Europe/Other markets 
In Western Europe, the economic recovery is expected to continue 
in 2016. Resolving structural problems will continue to represent a 
major challenge in this regard. 
For Central Europe, we expect growth rates to be similar to 
those of the past fiscal year. In Eastern Europe, the economic 
situation should stabilize, providing the conflict between Russia 
and Ukraine does not deteriorate. Russia’s economy will probably 
contract further, but at a slower pace than in the reporting period. Political uncertainty and social tensions resulting primarily from 
high unemployment levels will probably continue to weigh on the 
South African economy in 2016 and keep growth down. 
  Germany 
The German economy is expected to expand further in 2016 at 
slightly higher growth rates than in the reporting period. The 
situation in the labor market is also expected to remain stable. 
 
North America 
For North America, we anticipate that the robust economic per-
formance will continue in 2016. Growth in the 
USA and in Canada 
is expected to remain stable compared with the previous year, while 
the Mexican economy is slated to expand at a slightly slower rate.  
 
South America 
Mainly because of sluggish domestic demand, Brazil will probably 
record negative growth again in 2016. Weighed down by 
persistently high inflation and the muted business climate, 
economic growth in Argentina is expected to be slow. 
 
Asia-Pacific 
Economic growth in China is expected to remain at a high level in 
2016, but to lose further momentum compared to previous years. 
For India, we anticipate stable growth at comparatively high rates of 
expansion. In Japan, the economic situation will probably only 
improve slightly. In the 
ASEAN region, we estimate that the 
economy will continue to expand at approximately the same rate as 
in the reporting period.   
  

R
eport  on Expected  
Developments 
Growth in the global economy in 2016 is expected to be on a level with the previous year. 
We estimate global demand for vehicles will be mixed in 2016 and increase at a slower rate than in 
the reporting period. The Volkswagen Group intends to capitalize on this development by building on 
the strength of its brand diversity, global presence and pioneering technologies.",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Expected Developments 
164  TRENDS IN THE PASSENGER CAR MARKETS  We expect trends in the passenger car markets in the individual 
regions to be mixed in 2016. Overall, growth in global demand for 
new vehicles will probably be slower than in the reporting period.  
The Volkswagen Group is well positioned to deal with the mixed 
developments in the global automotive markets. Our broad, selec-
tively expanded product range featuring the latest generation of 
engines as well as a variety of alternative drives puts us in a good 
position globally compared with our competitors. Our goal is to 
offer all customers the mobility and innovations they need, 
sustainably strengthening our competitive position in the process. 
We estimate that demand for passenger cars worldwide will 
continue to increase in the period 2017 to 2020. 
Europe/Other markets 
For 2016, we anticipate that the demand volume in Western Europe 
will be in line with that of the reporting period. Pre-crisis levels are 
not expected to be reached, even in the medium term. The ongoing 
debt crisis will probably further unsettle consumers in many 
countries in the region and restrict their financial opportunities to 
buy new cars. In Spain and Italy, the recovery will probably continue 
in 2016 at a modest pace, while in the United Kingdom we 
anticipate that the market volume will be below the high level seen 
in the previous year. For France, we expect growth to be only slightly 
positive. 
In the Central and Eastern European markets, demand for 
passenger cars in 2016 is estimated to be under the weak prior-year 
figure. Following significant declines in previous years, the volume 
of demand in Russia will probably decrease again in 2016. We 
expect to see further growth in demand or volumes remaining at the 
previous year’s level in many Central European markets. 
We are projecting that the volume of the South African auto-
motive market will be significantly below the previous year’s figure 
in 2016. 
Germany 
Following the positive trend of recent years, we forecast that the 
volume of the German passenger car market in 2016 will remain 
level with the prior-year figure. 
 
North America 
In 2016, we expect that the market for passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles (up to 6.35 tonnes) in the 
USA will continue to 
benefit from favorable conditions and that the positive trend seen in 
the past year will endure at a weaker pace. Growth is expected to be 
driven mainly by the 
SUV and pickup segment. In the Canadian 
market, demand is likely to be slightly below the previous year’s 
  high level. In Mexico, however, we anticipate that the market 
volume will be noticeably higher than in 2015. 
  South America 
Owing to their dependence on demand for raw materials, the South 
American markets for passenger cars and light commercial vehi-
cles are heavily influenced by developments in the global economy. 
Furthermore, protectionist tendencies are adversely affecting the 
performance of the region’s vehicle markets, especially in Brazil 
and Argentina, which have imposed restrictions on vehicle imports. 
The volumes of the South American markets will probably fall con-
siderably short of the prior-year figures in 2016. In Brazil, the 
largest market in South America, we are forecasting that the volume 
of demand will be substantially lower than the already poor figure 
recorded in the previous year. In Argentina, we anticipate that, in 
view of persistently high inflation and the challenging macroeco-
nomic situation, demand will be noticeably down year-on-year, 
following significant declines in the previous two years. 
 
Asia-Pacific 
The passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region look set to 
continue their growth trajectory in 2016 at a similar pace. In China, 
the steady increase in individual mobility requirements will con-
tinue to push up demand; the rate of growth should be in line with 
the previous year. Tax breaks for vehicles with engine sizes of up to 
1.6 l are also expected to contribute to growth. Strong demand is 
still forecast for attractively priced entry-level models in the 
SUV 
segment. In India, we expect demand for passenger cars to slightly 
exceed the previous year. We anticipate that demand in the 
Japanese passenger car market will decline slightly in 2016. We are 
forecasting positive growth rates for the markets in the 
ASEAN 
region in 2016.  
 
TRENDS IN THE MARKETS FOR COMMERCIAL VEHICLES 
We expect trends in the markets for light commercial vehicles in the 
individual regions to be mixed again in 2016. Overall, we envisage 
slight growth in demand, a trend that is likely to continue in the 
period 2017 to 2020. 
Given that the economy is expected to recover further in 2016, 
we estimate that demand for light commercial vehicles in Western 
Europe will be in line with the prior-year figure. We anticipate that 
new registrations in Germany will be around the previous year’s level.  
In the Central and Eastern European markets, registrations of 
light commercial vehicles in 2016 will probably be flat on the 
previous year. We also expect the market volume in Russia to remain 
stable compared with 2015.  
In North and South America, the light vehicle market is 
reported as part of the passenger car market, which includes both 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Expected Developments  
165 The market volume in the Asia-Pacific region in 2016 will probably 
record a modest increase year-on-year. We are expecting demand 
in the Chinese market to be up on the previous year. For India we 
are forecasting a substantially higher volume in 2016 than in the 
reporting period. In the Japanese market, the downward trend is 
likely to continue in 2016 at a moderate pace. In the 
ASEAN region, 
we assume that the market will grow in 2016. 
 
In the markets for mid-sized and heavy trucks that are relevant for 
the Volkswagen Group, new registrations in 2016 are set to drop 
slightly below the prior-year level. For the period 2017 to 2020 we 
anticipate a positive trend, however.  
We expect to see demand in Western Europe and Germany 
slightly edge up year-on-year in 2016.  
Central and Eastern European markets should also record a 
slight uptick in demand. Following the significant slump in the 
Russian market in 2015, we are forecasting a moderate recovery in 
demand. Despite this backlog effect, the Russian market as a whole 
will remain at a low level. 
As pent-up demand in the US truck market has become 
saturated, new registrations in North America in 2016 will probably 
be down appreciably on the prior-year figure.  
Demand in the Brazilian market in 2016 will be substantially 
lower than the already weak figure recorded in the previous year. 
This is attributable to the economic conditions, which continue to 
be weighed down by the muted business climate and negative 
growth rates.  
For China, the world’s largest truck market, the significant 
market decline in 2015 will result in pent-up demand, so regis-
trations in 2016 will probably be noticeably higher than in the pre-
vious year. Nevertheless, this market will not reach the high level 
recorded in preceding years. In India, we expect sizable growth in 
the market on the strength of the positive economic climate and the 
implementation of numerous infrastructure measures. 
In the bus markets that are relevant for the Volkswagen Group, 
we expect that demand will decrease perceptibly in 2016. Following 
the sharp increase in Western Europe in 2015, we are likely to see 
demand dip slightly in 2016. For Central and Eastern Europe, we 
are forecasting that the volume of demand will be down signifi-
cantly on the previous year. In South America, new registrations 
will probably also be substantially lower than the prior-year level.  
For the period 2017 to 2020, we expect moderate growth overall 
in the bus markets that are relevant for the Volkswagen Group.  
  TRENDS IN THE MARKETS FOR POWER ENGINEERING 
We expect the overall difficult market environment and thus the 
price pressure in the power engineering segment to persist in 2016.  
We anticipate that the order volume for two-stroke engines, 
used in merchant shipping in 2016, will be similar to the prior-year 
figure. Calls for greater energy efficiency and low pollutant emis-
sions will have a significant influence on ship designs in the future. 
We expect to see continuing high demand for special-purpose ships 
such as cruise ships and government vessels. Despite long-term 
positive growth factors for offshore applications, expectations are 
that new orders will be at a low level in 2016 because of the persis-
tently low oil price. Overall, we estimate that the marine market will 
be on a level with the previous year. The competitive pressure will 
continue unabated.  
Demand for energy correlates strongly with macroeconomic 
and demographic trends, especially in developing countries  
and emerging markets. The global trend toward decentralized 
power stations and gas-based applications shows no sign of slowing 
down. This development is supported in particular by increasing 
improvements in the liquid gas infrastructure. We anticipate that 
demand will increase slightly year-on-year in 2016, but will remain 
at a low overall level.  
Both the processing and the oil and gas industries are expected 
to experience a persistently difficult market environment in fiscal 
year 2016, resulting in high price and competitive pressure. This is 
due to expectations that oil prices will remain low and unfavorable 
economic and political conditions will prevail in some relevant 
markets. We consequently envisage that in 2016 the market for 
turbomachinery will also settle at the previous year’s low level. 
Any substantial improvement in the German market for wind 
farms cannot yet be expected for 2016. 
For the period 2017 to 2020, demand is expected to grow in the 
power engineering market. 
 
DEMAND FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES 
We expect automotive financial services to continue to grow in 
importance worldwide in 2016. We anticipate that demand for 
financial services will increase more strongly in those emerging 
markets in which market penetration is currently low, such as 
China. In regions with developed automotive finance markets, 
there will be a further shift in the offering towards enabling 
mobility at a manageable total cost. Integrated end-to-end solutions, 
comprising service modules such as insurance and innovative

Report on Expected Developments 
166  packages of services, and new mobility offerings such as carsharing 
will become increasingly important. We also expect this trend to 
continue in the period 2017 to 2020. 
In the mid-sized and heavy commercial vehicles category, we 
expect rising demand for financial services products in emerging 
markets. There in particular, financing solutions support vehicle 
sales and are thus an essential component of the sales process. We 
anticipate increased demand in 2016 in the developed markets for 
services that reduce the total cost of ownership. This trend will 
continue in the period 2017 to 2020.  
EXCHANGE RATE TRENDS 
The global economy lost a little of its momentum in 2015. Falling 
energy and commodity prices, uncertainty about the change in the 
Chinese growth model and the declining confidence in the eco-
nomic stability of emerging markets resulted in further weakening 
of the currencies of those countries. The euro stabilized at a low 
level against the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi and sterling in the 
course of the year. Despite appreciating temporarily, the Russian 
ruble remained weak, losing substantial ground again in the 
second half of the year. For 2016, we are forecasting that the euro 
will gain some strength against the US dollar, Chinese renminbi, 
sterling and other key currencies. The expectation is that the 
Russian ruble will remain weak. We currently assume that these 
trends will continue in the period 2017 to 2020. There is still a 
general event risk – defined as the risk arising from unforeseen 
market developments. 
 
INTEREST RATE TRENDS 
Interest rates remained extremely low in fiscal year 2015 due to the 
continuation of expansionary monetary policy and the challenging 
overall economic environment. In the major Western industrialized 
nations, key interest rates persisted at a historic low level. While it 
became apparent in the 
USA and the UK that the extremely loose 
monetary policy was gradually drawing to an end, the European 
Central Bank continued to pursue this course. In light of further 
expansionary monetary policy measures in the eurozone, we there-
fore consider it unlikely that interest rates will rise significantly in 
2016. In the 
USA and the UK, however, we can expect to see a 
moderate increase in interest rates. For the period 2017 to 2020, 
we anticipate a gradual rise in interest rates.  
 
  COMMODITY PRICE TRENDS 
Many commodity prices decreased further in 2015. This was 
principally due to increasing excess supply in the global markets, 
but also to weaker economic growth in China and the strong US 
dollar. Assuming somewhat stronger growth in the global economy, 
we expect prices of most exchange-traded raw materials in 2016 to 
fluctuate around the current level. Provided there is a further 
recovery, we believe that commodity prices will rise in the period 
2017 to 2020.  
 
NEW MODELS IN 2016 
The Volkswagen Group will systematically press ahead with its 
model initiative in 2016, modernizing and expanding its portfolio 
by introducing attractive new vehicles. Priority will always be given 
to what our customers want. We are also successively enhancing our 
product portfolio by adding vehicles equipped with alternative drive 
systems, i.e. gas and electric versions. 
The Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand will launch the replace-
ment of the successful Tiguan 
SUV model in 2016. In addition, the 
Beetle family will be upgraded, and the Beetle Dune will be added to 
the range. Other product upgrades are planned for the up! and Golf 
Cabriolet as well as for the Gol, Voyage and Saveiro in Brazil. In 
China, the product program is being extended with the sporty 
GTS 
variant of the Lamando and the new luxury saloon Phideon. The 
locally produced successors to the popular Magotan notchback 
saloon, the versatile Touran and the new Golf Sportsvan will be 
launched there. In addition, there will be product upgrades for the 
locally produced Passat and Sagitar 
GLI models. 
The Audi brand is systematically expanding its 
SUV range: the 
new sporty compact entry-level model Q2 extends the Q family. 
Production of the new Q5 will start up at the new plant in Mexico. 
The successor to the A5 Coupé will also be unveiled in 2016. The A4 
family will be enhanced by adding the sporty S models S4 Saloon 
and S4 Avant as well as the A4 allroad quattro. Towards the end of 
the year, the A4 g-tron is expected to be introduced. In addition to 
natural gas, this car can also run on eco-friendly Audi e-gas. At the 
beginning of 2016, the long wheelbase version of the popular luxury 
class vehicle A6 L will moreover be unveiled in China, to be followed 
by the A6 L e-tron later in the year.  
ŠKODA will launch the Superb SportLine in 2016, thus 
introducing a sporty element to the Superb series.

Report on Expected Developments  
167 In 2016, the SEAT brand will expand its product portfolio by adding 
a new versatile 
SUV in the A segment: the Ateca. The popular Leon 
series will be upgraded. 
Porsche will enhance the new generation of the 911 in 2016 
with additions such as the all-wheel drive and Targa models and the 
911 Turbo. In addition, the new generation of the Cayman and the 
Boxster will be unveiled.  
Bentley will introduce a new series and launch the Bentayga, 
the world’s most luxurious and powerful 
SUV. The Mulsanne will be 
upgraded and a new variant with a lengthened wheelbase will be 
added. 
The super sports car manufacturer Lamborghini will unveil the 
Huracán LP 610-4 Spyder in 2016, which combines the technology 
and power of the Huracán with the emotion of a Spyder.  
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles will present the successor to 
the Crafter. The vehicle is produced at the purpose-built Wrzesnia 
plant in Poland and is a key component of the growth strategy of 
Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. The Amarok pickup, which has 
enjoyed international success, will get a comprehensive product 
upgrade. 
At Ducati, the Scrambler series will be expanded in 2016 with, 
among other things, the addition of a premium lifestyle model and 
the Flat Track Pro. The new XDiavel will complement Ducati’s 
Cruiser product range. An Enduro and the sporty 1200 Pike’s Peak 
will be added to the Multistrada series.  
 
STRATEGIC SALES FOCUS 
The multibrand structure, comprising largely independent, strong 
brands that nevertheless achieve maximum synergies, is one of the 
defining features of the Volkswagen Group. The structures in the 
Group have been designed for managing a multibrand organization.  
To facilitate the entry into new markets for more Group brands, 
we will further expand our multibrand structure, particularly in the 
growth markets. We will also strengthen our customer focus across 
all sales levels and in customer service, for which we are continually 
enhancing employee qualifications in addition to optimizing our 
processes and systems to reflect shifts in customer requirements as 
well as changing markets and technologies, in particular digitali-
zation. The focus of our sales strategy remains the same – the 
integrated marketing of new and used vehicles, financial and other 
services, as well as genuine parts and accessories.   TECHNICAL EXPERTISE, MOTIVATION AND HEALTH 
The central concern of the Volkswagen Group’s human resources 
work is to promote the expertise, motivation and health of our 
employees. This is the prerequisite for outstanding professional 
and engineering work.  
The dual vocational training and a university degree are the 
basis for professional development in the vocational groups at 
Volkswagen. Employees then obtain further qualifications throug-
hout their working lives. To always meet current requirements, the 
broad offering of qualifications is continuously being enhanced. For 
example, employees are prepared for the changes associated with 
the advancing digitalization and the use of new technologies under 
Industry 4.0. An important pillar of this strategy is the transfer of 
knowledge and experience by experts to other staff. Qualifications 
are provided in the form of dual vocational training and classroom 
education that closely integrate theoretical and practical forms of 
learning.  
 
INVESTMENT AND FINANCIAL PLANNING 
In our current planning for 2016, investments of a total of €15 bil-
lion will be made in the Automotive Division.  
Scheduled capex (investments in property, plant and equip-
ment, investment property and intangible assets, excluding capital-
ized development costs) will amount to approximately €12 billion, 
down on the figures of the previous planning round. The ratio of 
capex to sales revenue in 2016 will be at a level of 6 – 7%. The 
majority of capex will be spent on new products, the continued 
rollout and development of the modular toolkit and the completion 
of ongoing capacity expansion. These relate, for example, to 
product start-ups such as the next generation of the Golf and the 
Audi Q5, the new Crafter production facility in Poland plus upfront 
investments for the modular electrification toolkit. Roughly 50% of 
capex will be made at the Group’s 28 locations in Germany. 
Besides capex, investing activities will include additions of €5 
billion to capitalized development costs. Among other things, these 
reflect upfront expenditures in connection with compliance with 
environmental standards and the extension and updating of our 
model range. Activities will focus in particular on the rapid 
advancement of electric drives in the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, 
Audi and Porsche brands.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Expected Developments 
168  The investments in new facilities and models, as well as in the 
development of alternative drives and modular toolkits, are laying 
the foundations for profitable, sustainable growth at Volkswagen. 
These investments also include commitments arising from 
decisions taken in previous fiscal years. 
In March 2016, the sale of the leasing and fleet management 
company LeasePlan Corporation N.V. to a syndicate of investors was 
concluded. This transaction resulted in a positive effect of €2.2 bil-
lion on the Automotive Division’s investing activities. 
We intend to finance our investments in the Automotive 
Division using internally generated funds and expect cash flows 
from operating activities to exceed the Automotive Division’s invest-
ment requirements. As a result of the effects of the emissions issue, 
net cash flow in the Automotive Division will probably be signifi-
cantly lower than in the previous year. This does not include cash 
outflows for the legal handling of the emissions issue.  
These plans are based on the Volkswagen Group’s current 
structures. They do not take into account the possible settlement 
payable to other shareholders associated with the control and profit 
and loss transfer agreement with 
MAN SE. Our joint ventures in 
China are not consolidated and are therefore also not included in 
the above figures. These joint ventures will invest €4 billion in capex 
in 2016, to be financed from the companies’ own funds. 
In the Financial Services Division we are planning higher 
investments in 2016 than in the previous year. We expect the 
growth in lease assets and in receivables from leasing, customer 
and dealer financing to lead to funds tied up in working capital, of 
which around 45% will be financed from the gross cash flow. As is 
common in the sector, the remaining funds needed will be met 
primarily through asset-backed securities, customer deposits from 
direct banking business, unsecured bonds on the money and capital 
market as well as through the use of international credit lines. 
TARGETS FOR VALUE-BASED MANAGEMENT 
Based on long-term interest rates derived from the capital market 
and the target capital structure (fair value of equity to debt = 2:1), 
the minimum required rate of return on invested capital defined for 
the Automotive Division remains unchanged at 9%. Due in 
particular to the adverse effects of the special items on earnings, we 
fell considerably short of the minimum required rate of return in 
the reporting period, with a return on investment (
ROI) of –0.2% 
  (see also page 123). Invested capital will increase in 2016 as a result 
of the investments in new models and in the development of 
alternative drives and modular toolkits. The return on investment 
will be up substantially year-on-year, above the minimum required 
rate of return on invested capital of 9%.  
  FUTURE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE GROUP 
At its meeting on September 25, 2015, the Supervisory Board of 
Volkswagen AG passed resolutions for restructuring the Company. 
The Group is to have a new management model, which is being 
implemented since the beginning of 2016. The main changes are as 
follows:  
At Group level, the management structure will be based even 
more consistently on the modular toolkit system. In addition to 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars, 
SEAT and ŠKODA as the volume brands, 
Audi, Lamborghini and Ducati will form a brand group and Porsche 
will be in a brand group with Bentley and Bugatti. The commercial 
vehicles group with Scania and 
MAN as well as the Volkswagen 
Commercial Vehicles brand will remain in place, as will the Power 
Engineering and Financial Services business areas. 
Furthermore, Group functions will focus on efficiency and 
topics for the future. For this, organizational units will be set up for, 
among others, digitalization, the toolkit and product strategy, new 
business fields, as well as cooperation and equity investments.  
Existing corporate bodies, structures and processes will be 
streamlined at Group level, in particular by strengthening the 
individual brands and regions. The research and development, 
production and sales functions will be strategically assigned at 
Group level to the area for which the Chairman of the Board of 
Management is responsible. The existing responsibilities for these 
functions in the Group’s Board of Management will be transferred 
to the new organizational structure. 
The reorganization will also result in slight changes to the 
financial reporting. In the Automotive Division, the Commercial 
Vehicles/Power Engineering Business Area will in future be 
presented as two separate business areas in accordance with the 
segment reporting: Commercial Vehicles Business Area and Power 
Engineering Business Area. The Automotive Division will thus have 
three business areas: Passenger Cars, Commercial Vehicles and 
Power Engineering. The Financial Services Division, which corre-
sponds to the Financial Services segment, will remain unchanged.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Expected Developments  
169 SUMMARY OF EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS The Volkswagen Group’s Board of Management expects the global 
economy to record the same level of growth in 2016 as in the 
previous year. Risks will arise from turbulence in the financial 
markets and structural deficits in individual countries. In addition, 
growth prospects continue to be hurt by geopolitical tensions and 
conflicts. We expect the economic upturn to continue in most 
industrialized nations, with moderate rates of expansion overall. As 
in the previous year, growth will in all probability be muted in many 
emerging markets. We expect the strongest rates of expansion in 
Asia’s emerging economies. 
The trend in the automotive industry closely follows global eco-
nomic developments. Competition in the international automotive 
markets is likely to intensify further.  
We expect trends in the passenger car markets in the individual 
regions to be mixed in 2016. Overall, growth in global demand for 
new vehicles will probably be slower than in the reporting period. 
We anticipate that the demand volume in Western Europe and the 
German passenger car market will be in line with the previous year. 
In the Central and Eastern European markets, demand for 
passenger cars is estimated to be under the weak prior-year figure. 
In North America, we expect last year’s positive trend to continue at 
a slightly weaker pace. The volumes of the South American markets 
will probably fall noticeably short of the prior-year figures. The 
passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region look set to 
continue their growth path at a similar pace. 
Global demand for light commercial vehicles will probably see a 
slight increase in 2016. We expect trends to vary from region to region.  
In the markets for mid-sized and heavy trucks that are relevant 
for the Volkswagen Group, new registrations in 2016 are set to drop 
slightly below the prior-year level, while new registrations of buses 
in the relevant markets will probably be noticeably lower than in the 
previous year. 
We expect automotive financial services to continue to grow in 
importance worldwide in 2016.  
The Volkswagen Group is well positioned to deal with the mixed 
developments in the global automotive markets. Our broad, selec-
tively expanded product range featuring the latest generation of 
engines as well as a variety of alternative drives puts us in a good 
position globally compared with our competitors. The Group’s 
strengths include in particular its unique brand portfolio, its steadily 
growing presence in all major world markets and its wide selection 
of financial services. Our range of models span from motorcycles 
through compact, sports and luxury cars to heavy trucks and buses, 
and covers almost all segments. The Volkswagen Group’s brands 
will press ahead with their product initiative in 2016, modernizing 
and expanding their offering by introducing new models. Our goal is to offer all customers the mobility and innovations they need, 
sustainably strengthening our competitive position in the process. 
We expect that, on the whole, deliveries to customers of the 
Volkswagen Group in 2016 will be on a level with the previous year 
amid persistently challenging market conditions, with a growing 
volume in China. 
In addition to the emissions issue, the highly competitive 
environment as well as interest rate and exchange rate volatility and 
fluctuations in raw materials prices all pose challenges. We antici-
pate positive effects from the efficiency programs implemented by 
all brands and from the modular toolkits. 
Depending on the economic conditions – particularly in South 
America and Russia – and the exchange rate development and in 
light of the emissions issue, we expect 2016 sales revenue for the 
Volkswagen Group to be down by as much as 5% on the prior-year 
figure. In terms of the Group’s operating result, we anticipate an 
operating return on sales of between 5.0% and 6.0% in 2016.  
In the Passenger Cars Business Area we expect a sharp decrease 
in sales revenue, with an operating return on sales in the antici-
pated range of 5.5 – 6.5%. With sales revenue in the Commercial 
Vehicles Business Area remaining essentially unchanged, we 
anticipate that the operating return on sales will be between 2.0% 
and 4.0%. We expect sales revenue in the Power Engineering 
Business Area to be perceptibly lower than the prior-year figure, 
with a significantly reduced operating result. For the Financial 
Services Division, we are forecasting sales revenue and the 
operating result at the prior-year level.  
At Group level, we still endeavor to achieve a sustainable return 
on sales before tax of at least 8%. 
In the Automotive Division, the ratio of capex to sales revenue 
will fluctuate around a level of 6 – 7% in 2016. The return on invest-
ment (
ROI) will be up substantially year-on-year, above the mini-
mum required rate of return on invested capital of 9%. As a result of 
the effects of the emissions issue, net cash flow will probably be 
significantly lower than in the previous year. Our unchanged stated 
goal is continue our solid liquidity policy. 
The Group’s new structure with more decentralized responsi-
bility will strengthen our brands and regions and increase our 
proximity to customers. In addition, we are working to make even 
more focused use of the advantages of our multibrand group by 
continuously developing new technologies and toolkits. The com-
mitment and considerable technical expertise of our staff are key 
prerequisites to mastering the current and future challenges facing 
us and to being successful. The central concern of the Volkswagen 
Group’s human resources work is therefore to promote the expertise 
and motivation of our employees. Disciplined cost and investment 
management and the continuous optimization of our processes are 
integral elements of the Volkswagen Group’s strategy.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
170  In this chapter, we first explain the objective and structure of the 
Volkswagen Group’s risk management system (
RMS) and internal 
control system (
ICS) and describe the system relevant for the 
financial reporting process. We then outline the main risks and 
opportunities arising in our business activities. 
 
OBJECTIVE OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL 
CONTROL SYSTEM AT VOLKSWAGEN 
Only by promptly identifying, accurately assessing and effectively 
and efficiently managing the risks and opportunities arising from 
our business activities can we ensure the Volkswagen Group’s 
sustainable success. The aim of the 
RMS/ICS is to identify potential 
risks at an early stage so that suitable countermeasures can be 
taken to avert the threat of loss to the Company, and any risks that 
might jeopardize its continued existence can be ruled out. 
Assessing the probability and extent of future events and devel-
opments is, by its nature, subject to uncertainty. We are therefore 
aware that even the best 
RMS cannot foresee all potential risks and 
even the best 
ICS can never completely prevent irregular acts. 
STRUCTURE OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND INTERNAL 
CONTROL SYSTEM AT VOLKSWAGEN 
The organizational design of the Volkswagen Group’s  RMS/ICS is 
based on the internationally recognized 
COSO framework for 
enterprise risk management (
COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). In the reporting 
period, Volkswagen again pursued a holistic, integrated approach 
that combines a risk management system, an internal control 
system and a compliance management system ( CMS) within a single 
management strategy (governance, risk and compliance strategy). 
Structuring the 
RMS/ICS in accordance with the COSO framework 
for enterprise risk management ensures that potential risks are 
covered in full; opportunities are not recorded. Uniform Group 
principles are used as the basis for managing risks in a consistent 
manner. 
With this approach we not only fulfil legal requirements, partic-
ularly with regard to the financial reporting process, but we are also 
able to manage significant risks to the Group holistically, i.e. by 
incorporating both tangible and intangible criteria.  
Another key element of the 
RMS/ICS at Volkswagen is the three 
lines of defense model, a basic element required, among others, by 
the European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing 
(
ECIIA). In line with this model, the Volkswagen Group’s  RMS/ICS 
has three lines of defense that are designed to protect the Company 
from significant risks occurring. 
No significant changes were made to the 
RMS/ICS in 2015. In 
connection with the examination of the emissions issue, we started 
to analyze possible viable enhancements to the system in the 
reporting period. These include, among other things, reinforcing 
the internal control system in the area of product compliance.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities

First line of defense: operational risk management 
The primary line of defense comprises the operational risk man-
agement and internal control systems at the individual Group 
companies and business units. The 
RMS/ICS is an integral part of 
the Volkswagen Group’s structure and workflows. Events that may 
give rise to risk are identified and assessed locally in the divisions 
and at the investees. Countermeasures are introduced immediately, 
their effects are assessed and the information is incorporated into 
the planning in a timely manner. The results of the operational risk 
management process are incorporated into budget planning and 
financial control on an ongoing basis. The targets agreed in the 
budget planning rounds are continually reviewed in revolving 
planning updates. 
At the same time, the results of risk mitigation measures that 
have already been taken are incorporated into the monthly fore-
casts on further business development without delay. This means 
that the Board of Management also has access to an overall picture 
of the current risk situation via the documented reporting channels 
during the year. 
The minimum requirements for the operational risk manage-
ment and internal control system are set out for the entire Group in 
uniform guidelines. These also include a process for the timely 
reporting of material risks.  Second line of defense: identifying systemic risks using the regular 
Governance, Risk and Compliance process 
In addition to the units’ ongoing operational risk management, the 
Group Governance, Risk and Compliance (
GRC) department each 
year sends standardized surveys on the risk situation and the 
effectiveness of the 
RMS/ICS to the material Group companies and 
units worldwide (regular 
GRC process). The feedback is used to 
update the overall picture of the potential risk situation and assess 
the effectiveness of the system. 
Each systemic risk reported is assessed using the expected like-
lihood of occurrence and various risk criteria (financial and non-
financial). In addition, the measures taken to manage and control 
risk are documented at management level. This means that risks 
are assessed in the context of any risk management measures 
initiated, i.e. in a net analysis. In addition to strategic, operational 
and reporting risks, risks arising from potential compliance vio-
lations are also integrated into this process. Moreover, the effective-
ness of key risk management and control measures is tested and 
any weaknesses identified in the process are reported and rectified.  
All Group companies and units selected from among the 
entities in the consolidated Group on the basis of materiality and 
risk criteria were subject to the regular 
GRC process in fiscal year 
2015. Only the Scania brand was excluded.  
The consolidated Scania brand has not yet been included in the 
Volkswagen Group’s risk management system due to various pro-
visions of Swedish company law, but its gradual inclusion is planned 
from 2016 onward. According to Scania’s corporate governance 
report, risk management and risk assessment are integral parts of 
corporate management. Risk areas at Scania are evaluated by the 
brand’s Controlling department and reflected in the financial 
reporting.  
Third line of defense: checks by Group Internal Audit 
Group Internal Audit helps the Board of Management to monitor 
the various divisions and corporate units within the Group. It 
regularly checks the risk early warning system and the structure 
and implementation of the 
RMS/ICS and the CMS as part of its 
independent audit procedures.

RISK EARLY WARNING SYSTEM IN LINE WITH THE KONTRAG 
The Company’s risk situation is ascertained, assessed and docu-
mented in accordance with the requirements of the Gesetz zur 
Kontrolle und Transparenz im Unternehmensbereich (KonTraG  
– German Act on Control and Transparency in Business). The 
requirements for a risk early warning system are met through the 
elements of the 
RMS/ICS described above (first and second lines of 
defense). Independently of this, the external auditors check both 
the processes and procedures implemented in this respect and the 
adequacy of the documentation on an annual basis. The plausibility 
and adequacy of the risk reports are examined on a random basis in 
detailed interviews with the divisions and companies concerned 
that also involve the external auditors. The latter assessed our risk 
early warning system based on this volume of data and established 
that the risks identified were presented and communicated 
accurately. The risk early warning system therefore meets the 
requirements of the KonTraG.  
In addition, the Financial Services Division is subject both to 
scheduled examinations as part of the audit of the annual financial 
statements and to also unscheduled audits, in particular by the 
Banking Supervision Committee of the European Central Bank 
(
ECB-SSM) and by the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungs-
aufsicht (BaFin – the German Federal Financial Supervisory Author-
ity) within the meaning of section 44 of the Kreditwesengesetz (
KWG 
– German Banking Act), as well as examinations by the Prüfungs-
verband deutscher Banken (Auditing Association of German Banks).   Monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management system and 
the internal control system 
The RMS/ICS is regularly optimized as part of our continuous 
monitoring and improvement processes. In the process, equal 
consideration is given to both internal and external requirements. 
External experts assist in the continuous enhancement of our 
RMS/ICS on a case-by-case basis. The objective of the monitoring 
and improvements is to ensure the effectiveness of the 
RMS/ICS. 
The results culminate in both regular and event-driven reporting to 
the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG. 
 
THE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTEGRATED INTERNAL CONTROL 
SYSTEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS 
The accounting-related part of the  RMS/ICS that is relevant for the 
financial statements of Volkswagen AG and the Volkswagen Group 
comprises measures that are intended to ensure the complete, 
accurate and timely transmission of the information required for 
the preparation of the financial statements of Volkswagen AG, the 
consolidated financial statements and the combined Group manage-
ment report. These measures are designed to minimize the risk of 
material misstatement in the accounts and in the external reporting. 
 
Main features of the risk management and integrated internal 
control system relevant for the financial reporting process 
The Volkswagen Group’s accounting is basically organized along 
decentralized lines. For the most part, accounting duties are per-
formed by the consolidated companies themselves or entrusted to 
the Group’s shared service centers. In principle, the audited finan-
cial statements of Volkswagen AG and its subsidiaries prepared in 
accordance with 
IFRSs and the Volkswagen  IFRS accounting 
manual are transmitted to the Group in encrypted form. A standard 
market product is used for encryption. 
The Volkswagen 
IFRS accounting manual, which has been 
prepared using external expert opinions in certain cases, ensures 
the application of uniform accounting policies based on the 
requirements applicable to the parent. In particular, it includes 
more detailed guidance on the application of legal requirements 
and industry-specific issues. Components of the reporting packages 
required to be prepared by the Group companies are also set out in 
detail there and requirements established for the presentation and 
settlement of intragroup transactions and the balance recon-
ciliation process that builds on this.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
173 Control activities at Group level include analyzing and, if necessary, 
adjusting the data reported in the financial statements presented by 
the subsidiaries, taking into account the reports submitted by the 
auditors and the outcome of the meetings on the financial 
statements with representatives of the individual companies. These 
discussions address both the reasonableness of the single-entity 
financial statements and specific significant issues at the subsid-
iaries. Alongside reasonableness reviews, control mechanisms 
applied during the preparation of the single-entity and consolidated 
financial statements of Volkswagen AG include the clear delineation 
of areas of responsibility and the application of the dual control 
principle. 
The Group management report is prepared – in accordance 
with the applicable requirements and regulations – centrally but 
with the involvement of and in consultation with the Group units 
and companies. 
In addition, the accounting-related internal control system is 
independently reviewed by Group Internal Audit in Germany and 
abroad. 
 
Integrated consolidation and planning system 
The Volkswagen consolidation and corporate management system 
(VoKUs) enables the Volkswagen Group to consolidate and analyze 
both Financial Reporting’s backward-looking data and Con-
trolling’s budget data. VoKUs offers centralized master data 
management, uniform reporting, an authorization concept and 
maximum flexibility with regard to changes to the legal environ-
ment, providing a future-proof technical platform that benefits 
Group Financial Reporting and Group Controlling in equal 
measure. To verify data consistency, VoKUs has a multi-level 
validation system that primarily checks content plausibility between 
the balance sheet, the income statement and the notes.  
 
RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
In this section, we outline the risks and opportunities that arise in 
the course of our business activities. We have grouped them into 
categories. Unless explicitly mentioned, there were no material 
changes to the specific risks and opportunities compared with the 
previous year.  
The emissions issue gives rise to additional risks for the 
Volkswagen Group and also has an impact on existing risks. These 
are described under the respective risk category. 
We use competitive and environmental analyses and market 
studies to identify not only risks but also opportunities with a 
  positive impact on the design of our products, the efficiency with 
which they are produced, their success in the market and our cost 
structure. Where they can be assessed, risks and opportunities that 
we expect to occur are already reflected in our medium-term 
planning and our forecast. The following therefore reports on 
internal and external developments as risks and opportunities that 
may result in a negative or positive deviation from our forecast. 
  Risks from the emissions issue 
In 2015, the Volkswagen Group recognized provisions arising from 
the emissions issue, in particular for the upcoming service 
campaigns, recalls and customer-related measures, but also for 
residual value risks.  
Due to existing estimation risks particularly from legal risks, 
criminal and administrative proceedings, higher expenses for 
technical solutions, lower market prices, repurchase obligations 
and customer-related measures, further significant financial lia-
bilities may emerge. Demand may decrease – possibly exacerbated by 
a loss of reputation or insufficient communication. Other potential 
consequences include lower margins in the new and used car 
businesses and a temporary increase in funds tied up in working 
capital.  
The funding needed to cover the risks may lead to assets having 
to be sold due to the situation and equivalent proceeds for them not 
being achieved as a result.  
Our ability to use refinancing instruments may possibly be 
restricted in the future or precluded for existing instruments due to 
the current uncertainties regarding the effects of the emissions 
issue on the Volkswagen Group. A downgrade of the Company’s 
rating could also adversely affect the terms associated with the 
Volkswagen Group’s borrowings.  
We are cooperating with all the responsible authorities to 
clarify these matters completely and transparently. 
Macroeconomic risks and opportunities 
We believe that the risks to continued global economic growth lie 
primarily in turbulence in the financial markets and structural 
deficits, which pose a threat to the performance of some 
industrialized nations and emerging economies. In the southern 
part of the eurozone, a sustained economic recovery is being 
hindered by the situation of some financial institutions whose 
ability to withstand a crisis is still not assured. Persistently high 
private- and public-sector debt in many places is also clouding the 
outlook for growth and may cause markets to respond negatively.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
174  Declines in growth in key countries and regions often have an 
immediate impact on the state of the global economy and therefore 
pose a central risk.  
The economic development of some emerging economies is 
being hampered primarily by dependence on energy and commodity 
prices, capital inflows and socio-political tensions. Corruption, 
inadequate government structures and a lack of legal certainty also 
pose risks. 
Geopolitical tensions and conflicts are a further major risk to 
the performance of individual economies and regions. As the global 
economy becomes increasingly interconnected, it is also vulnerable 
to local developments. Any increasing escalation of the conflicts in 
Eastern Europe, the Middle East or Africa, for example, could cause 
further upheaval on the global energy and commodity markets and 
exacerbate migration trends. The same goes for armed conflicts, 
terrorist activities, or the spread of infectious diseases, which may 
prompt unexpected, short-term responses from the markets. 
Overall, we consider the probability of a global recession to be 
low. Due to the risk factors mentioned, however, the possibility of a 
decline in global economic growth or a period of below-average 
growth rates cannot be ruled out. 
The macroeconomic environment may also give rise to oppor-
tunities for the Volkswagen Group if actual developments differ in a 
positive way from expected developments.  
Sector-specific risk and market opportunities 
The growth markets of Asia, South America, and Central and 
Eastern Europe are particularly important to the Volkswagen Group 
in terms of the global trend in demand for passenger cars and 
commercial vehicles. Although these markets harbor considerable 
potential, the underlying conditions in some of the countries in 
these regions make it difficult to increase unit sales figures there. 
Some have high customs barriers or minimum local content 
requirements for domestic production, for example. The market 
development in Russia was again inhibited by the political crisis 
and its economic consequences in fiscal year 2015. In South 
America, structural deficits continued to have a negative impact. 
Restrictions on vehicle registrations could enter into force in 
further Chinese metropolitan areas in the future. Additionally, a 
global economic slowdown could negatively impact consumer 
confidence. Furthermore, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility 
of freight deliveries being shifted from trucks to other means of 
transport and of demand for the Group’s commercial vehicles 
falling as a result. 
At the same time, if the economic and regulatory situation 
permits, there are opportunities for faster growth above and 
beyond current projections in emerging markets where vehicle 
densities are still low. The demand that built up in some established 
markets during the crisis could also bring a more marked recovery 
in these markets if the economic environment eases more quickly 
than expected. Price pressure in established automotive markets due to high 
market saturation is a particular challenge for the Volkswagen 
Group as a supplier of volume and premium models. As the global 
economy is still under strain, competitive pressures are likely to 
remain high in the future. Some manufacturers may respond by 
offering incentives in order to meet their sales targets, putting the 
entire sector under additional pressure, particularly in Western 
Europe, the  USA and China. 
Western Europe is one of our main sales markets. A drop in 
prices due to the economic climate triggered by falling demand in 
this region would have a particularly strong impact on the Com-
pany’s earnings. We counter this risk with a clear, customer-
oriented and innovative product and pricing policy. Outside 
Western Europe, delivery volumes are widely spread around the 
world; the Chinese market accounts for a large share. We either 
already have a strong presence in numerous existing and 
developing markets or are working hard to build such a presence. 
Moreover, strategic partnerships help us to increase our presence 
in these countries and regions and cater to requirements there. 
In fiscal year 2015, economic trends varied considerably from 
region to region: whereas the situation in Western Europe continued 
to stabilize, the growth trend in China developed at a weaker pace. 
The US economy expanded solidly, but market conditions in 
Eastern Europe and South America remained under strain. The 
resulting challenges for our trading and sales companies, such as 
efficient inventory management and a profitable dealer network, 
are considerable and are being met by appropriate measures on 
their part. However, financing business activities through bank 
loans remains difficult. Our financial services companies offer 
dealers financing on attractive terms with the aim of strengthening 
their business models and reducing operational risk. We have 
installed a comprehensive liquidity risk management system so that 
we can promptly counteract any liquidity bottlenecks at the dealers’ 
end that could hinder smooth business operations.  
We continue to approve loans for vehicle finance on the basis of 
the same cautious principles applied in the past, taking into account 
the regulatory requirements of section 25a(1) of the Kreditwesen-
gesetz (
KWG – German Banking Act).  
Volkswagen may be exposed to increased competition in after-
markets for two reasons in particular: firstly, because of the pro-
visions of the block exemption regulations, which have been in 
force for after-sales service since June 2010, and, secondly, 
because of the amendments included in EU Regulation 566/2011 of 
June 8, 2011, which expand independent market participants’ 
access to technical information. 
In addition, the European Commission is currently evaluating 
the market with regard to existing design protection. If design 
protection for visible genuine parts were to be abolished as a result, 
this could adversely affect the Volkswagen Group’s genuine parts 
business.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
175 Below, we outline the market opportunities for the Volkswagen 
Group. We see the greatest potential for growth in the markets of 
the Asia-Pacific region and in North America. 
 
China  
Growth in China, the largest market in the Asia-Pacific region, 
progressed at a slower pace in the reporting period. The demand 
for vehicles will continue to rise there in the coming years due to the 
need for individual mobility, but will shift from the large coastal 
cities to the interior of the country. In order to leverage the con-
siderable opportunities offered by this market – also with regard to 
e-mobility – and to defend our strong market position in China over 
the long term, we are continuously expanding our product range to 
include models that have been specially developed for this market. 
We are further expanding our production capacity in this growing 
market through additional production facilities. 
 
India 
The political and economic situation in India further stabilized in 
2015. The vehicle markets continued their recovery. We expect this 
to continue. The Group is currently consolidating its activities in 
this environment. India remains a strategically important market of 
the future for the Group. 
 
ASEAN 
The automotive markets in the  ASEAN economic area are volatile, 
but offer substantial growth opportunities in the aggregate. The 
Volkswagen Group is working successively to achieve long-term 
penetration of these markets. High price sensitivity means that 
having a local manufacturing operation in the region is a condition 
for a competitive offering. Together with our partners in Malaysia 
and Indonesia, we locally assemble models from the Volkswagen 
Passenger Cars, Audi and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles brands. 
We are also examining and assessing such opportunities in 
additional countries in the region. Independent of such business, 
we are driving forward improvements to local sales structures.  
 
North America  
The US vehicle market saw growth again in 2015 thanks to the 
encouraging economic trend and favorable financing conditions. 
The market’s momentum is, however, expected to decrease. North 
America remains a growth region for the Volkswagen Group. In the 
United States, Volkswagen Group of America is systematically 
pursuing our strategy of becoming a full-fledged volume supplier. 
An engine plant and the development of additional production 
capacity in the region will allow the Group to better serve the market 
in the future. The Group is also pressing forward with additional 
products tailored specifically to the US market, for example a large 
SUV. Our market success will largely depend on how transparently, 
  thoroughly and quickly we deal with the diesel issue and restore 
customers’ confidence. 
  Brazil 
In Brazil, the economic environment weakened again and the 
vehicle market slumped further. Vehicles became more expensive 
as inflation and interest rates rose. The anticipated recovery failed 
to materialize and, instead, the economic outlook continued to 
worsen. We expect the downturn in the vehicle market to persist in 
2016. The growing number of automobile manufacturers with local 
production has resulted in a sharp increase in price pressure and 
competition. The Brazilian market plays a key role for the Volks-
wagen Group. To strengthen our competitive position here, we offer 
vehicles that have been specially developed for this market and are 
locally produced, such as the Gol and the Fox. 
 
Russia 
Russia has the potential to grow into one of the largest automotive 
markets in the world. However, its heavy reliance on currently lower 
oil revenues and the weak ruble led to a decline in the market as a 
whole in 2015. Demand for vehicles also continued to be impacted 
by the political crisis and the related sanctions imposed by the EU 
and the 
USA. The market remains of strategic importance for the 
Volkswagen Group, which is why we are working intensively there. 
 
The Middle East 
Despite economic and political instability, the Middle East region 
offers growth opportunities. We are leveraging the potential for 
sustainable growth with a range of vehicles that has been specif-
ically tailored to this market, without operating our own production 
facilities.  
 
Power Engineering 
The underlying global economic trends will continue. These include 
sustained economic growth, a greater international division of 
labor and a resulting increase in global transport routes and 
volumes, a growing demand for energy and forces for innovation 
powered by trends in global climate policy.  
We are working systematically to leverage these market oppor-
tunities at a global level. In the medium term, significant potential 
can be leveraged by enhancing the after-sales business by intro-
ducing new products and expanding the service network. Going 
forward, stricter requirements with respect to reliability, avail-
ability of the plants that are already in operation, the increase in 
environmental compatibility and efficient operation, together with 
the large number of engines and plants, will provide the basis for 
profitable, long-term growth.  
As part of the capital goods industry, the Power Engineering 
Business Area is subject to fluctuations in the investment climate. 
  
  ",,,,,,,,,,
207," 
  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
176  Even minor changes in growth or growth forecasts, resulting from 
geopolitical uncertainties or volatile commodities and foreign 
exchange markets, for example, can lead to significant changes in 
demand or the cancellation of existing orders. We counter the 
considerable economic risks with, for example, flexible production 
concepts and cost flexibility, utilizing temporary employment, 
working time accounts and short-time work as well as potential 
structural adjustments. The latter may possibly entail substantial 
one-time expenses.  
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RISK 
We conduct extensive trend analyses, customer surveys and 
scouting activities so as to reflect our customers’ requirements 
during product development as well as possible. This way we ensure 
that we identify trends at an early stage and examine their relevance 
for our customers in good time.  
We counter the risk that it may not be possible to develop pro-
ducts or modules within the specified timeframe, to the required 
quality standards, or in line with cost specifications by continuously 
and systematically monitoring the progress of all projects and 
increasingly analyzing third-party industrial property rights, 
including in relation to communication technologies. We regularly 
compare this progress with the project’s original targets; in the 
event of variances, we introduce appropriate countermeasures in 
good time. Our end-to-end project organization supports effective 
cooperation among all areas involved in the process, ensuring that 
specific requirements are incorporated into the development 
process as early as possible and that their implementation is 
planned in good time. 
 
Opportunities arising from the Modular Transverse Toolkit 
The Modular Transverse Toolkit  (MQB) and the Modular Produc-
tion Toolkit 
(MPB) enable us to cut both development costs and the 
necessary one-time expenses and manufacturing times, as well as 
making usage possible over several vehicle generations. The 
toolkits also allow us to produce different models from different 
brands in various quantities, using the same system in a single plant. 
This means that our capacities can be used with greater flexibility 
throughout the entire Group, enabling us to achieve efficiency gains.  
In addition to conventional petrol and diesel engines, the 
MQB 
also affords us the opportunity to integrate alternative drivetrains, 
such as natural gas, hybrid, or electric drives. Previously, individual, 
vehicle-specific adaptations were necessary for each model. The 
MQB has created an extremely flexible vehicle architecture that 
permits dimensions determined by the concept – such as the 
wheelbase, track width, wheel size and seat position – to be 
harmonized throughout the Group and utilized flexibly. Other 
dimensions, for example the distance between the pedals and the 
middle of the front wheels, are always the same and ensure a 
uniform system in the front of the car, enabling synergies to be 
achieved.   Procurement risks and opportunities 
The procurement risk management system continuously and 
globally monitors the financial situation of our suppliers and takes 
targeted measures to avoid supply bottlenecks. 
Economic recovery in Europe has contributed to the further 
stabilization of our supply base at an overall good level of capacity 
utilization and good margin situation. Large and innovative 
suppliers in particular have benefited from this. However, there has 
been an increase in the number of insolvencies globally due to 
highly volatile individual markets. The unfavorable economic 
developments in South America and Russia in 2015 led to capacity 
adjustments by suppliers and, in some cases, to demands for higher 
prices. At the same time, there was consolidation in the market.  
In China, the lower economic growth and increasing com-
petition led to a consolidation of the supplier base. We are therefore 
now also looking more closely at suppliers in this region from the 
point of view of preventive risk management.  
The trend in procurement is to bundle contracts to a greater 
extent and to ensure worldwide availability of uniform components. 
This is resulting in an increased need for financing and further 
consolidation in the supply industry. The Volkswagen Group’s pro-
curement risk management system therefore assesses suppliers 
before they are commissioned to perform projects. Among other 
things, the procurement function considers the risk of there being 
insufficient competition if it concentrates on a few financially 
strong suppliers when awarding contracts. Quality problems may 
necessitate technical measures involving a considerable financial 
outlay where costs cannot be passed on to the supplier or can only 
be passed on to a limited extent. In addition to financial difficulties, 
supply risks may, for example, arise as a result of fires or accidents 
at suppliers. The supplier risks are automatically identified without 
delay in the procurement function through early warning systems 
and mitigated immediately by applying inferred measures. 
Our modular toolkit strategy enables us to bundle volumes of 
vehicle parts and harmonize and synchronize requests for pro-
posals and procurement processes. We systematically enhanced 
this strategy in the A0 vehicle class, which allowed us to consolidate 
worldwide volumes into a single global request. In the process, we 
consider regional market requirements with the aim of maximizing 
customer satisfaction. This enables us to exploit transregional 
synergies while at the same time minimizing start-up risks within 
the Volkswagen Group, one-time expenses and internal process 
costs. 
Optimum use of the possibilities of a worldwide procurement 
system is a central theme of the Group initiative “Future Automotive 
Supply Tracks – Volkswagen 
FAST”. To ensure that we choose the 
best possible suppliers, we always weigh transregional synergies 
and the opportunity of acquiring a qualified partner for innovative 
projects against the risks of dependency.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
177 Production risk 
Developments on the global automotive markets, the train strikes in 
Germany, fires at suppliers and storms, as well as the emissions 
issue towards the end of 2015, caused production volumes of 
several vehicle models to fluctuate at some plants. We address such 
fluctuations using a variety of tried-and-tested tools, such as flexible 
working time models. The technical design of the production 
network enables us to respond dynamically to changes in demand at 
the sites. “Turntable concepts” even out capacity utilization between 
production facilities. At multibrand sites, the number of which is 
growing in the Group, volatile demand can also be smoothed across 
brands. 
Short-term fluctuations in customer demand for specific equip-
ment features in our products and the decreasing predictability of 
demand may lead to supply bottlenecks. We minimize this risk, 
among other things, by continuously comparing our available 
resources against different future demand scenarios. If we identify 
potential bottlenecks in the supply of materials, we can introduce 
countermeasures far enough in advance. 
Production capacity is planned several years in advance for 
each vehicle project on the basis of expected sales trends. These are 
subject to market changes and generally entail a degree of uncer-
tainty. If forecasts are too optimistic, there is a risk that capacity will 
not be fully utilized. Forecasts that are too pessimistic pose a risk of 
undercapacity, as a result of which it may not be possible to meet 
customer demand. 
Events beyond our control such as natural disasters or other 
events, for example fires, explosions or the leakage of substances 
hazardous to health and/or the environment, may adversely affect 
production to a significant extent. As a consequence, bottlenecks or 
even outages may occur, thus preventing the planned volume of 
production from being achieved. We address such risks with, 
among other things, fire protection measures and hazardous goods 
management and cover them – where financially viable – using 
insurance.  
The range of our models is growing, while at the same time 
product lifecycles are becoming shorter; the number of new vehicle 
start-ups at our sites worldwide is therefore increasing. The 
processes and technical systems we use for this are complex and 
there is thus a risk that vehicle deliveries may be delayed. We 
address this risk by drawing on experience of past start-ups and, 
identifying weaknesses at an early stage, so as to ensure that 
production volumes and quality standards are met during our new 
vehicle start-ups throughout the Group. In order to prevent downtime in general, lost output, rejects and 
reworking, we use the  TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) method 
at our production facilities. 
TPM is a continuous process involving 
the entire workforce. Round-the-clock maintenance of the 
technical facilities means that they are always operational and 
guaranteed to function reliably. 
 
Risks arising from long-term production 
In the case of large projects, risks may arise that are often only 
identified in the course of the project. They may result in particular 
from contract drafting errors, miscosting, post-contract changes in 
economic and technical conditions, weaknesses in project man-
agement, or poor performance by subcontractors. In particular, 
omissions or errors made at the start of a project are usually difficult 
to compensate for or correct and often entail substantial additional 
expenses.  
We endeavor to identify these risks at an even earlier stage and 
to take appropriate measures to eliminate or minimize them before 
they occur by constantly optimizing the project control process 
across all project phases and by using lessons learned process and 
regular project reviews. We can thus further reduce risk, partic-
ularly during the bidding and planning phase for large upcoming 
projects.  
 
Risks arising from changes in demand 
As a result of the emissions issue – possibly exacerbated by media 
reports – the Volkswagen Group may possibly experience decreases 
in demand. When dealing with the issue, our highest priority is to 
provide customers with solutions, both from a technical perspective 
and in financial matters. In addition, we are pressing ahead with 
the systematic clarification of the misconduct in the Company. 
Consumer demand is shaped not only by real factors such as 
disposable income, but also by psychological factors that cannot be 
planned for. Unexpected buyer reluctance, possibly further 
exacerbated by media reports, could stem from households’ 
worries about the future economic situation, for example. This is 
particularly the case in saturated automotive markets such as 
Western Europe, where demand could drop as a result of owners 
holding on to their vehicles for longer. In the reporting period, it 
became evident that the effects of the eurozone debt crisis have not 
yet been overcome. Several automotive markets, particularly in 
Southern Europe, were able to further recover from their record 
lows, however, and exhibited positive growth rates. We are 
countering this buyer reluctance with our attractive range of models 
and systematic customer orientation.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
178  A combination of buyer reluctance as a result of the crisis and 
increases in some vehicle taxes based on CO
2 emissions – as is 
already the case in some European countries – is driving a shift in 
demand towards smaller segments and engines in individual 
markets. We counter the risk that such a shift will negatively impact 
the Volkswagen Group’s earnings by constantly developing new, 
fuel-efficient vehicles and alternative drive technologies, based on 
our drivetrain and fuel strategy. Automotive markets around the 
world are exposed to risks from government intervention such as 
tax increases, which curb private consumption.  
Commercial vehicles are capital goods: in an economic upturn, 
the need for transport and thus the demand rises sharply, whereas 
in economically difficult times demand falls just as sharply. The 
production fluctuations arising as a result require a high degree of 
flexibility from manufacturers. Although production volumes are 
significantly lower, the complexity of the trucks and buses range in 
fact significantly exceeds the already very high complexity of the 
passenger cars’ range. The priorities for commercial vehicle cus-
tomers are overall running costs, vehicle reliability and the service 
provided.  
MAN Power Engineering’s two-stroke engines are produced 
exclusively by licensees, particularly in Korea, China and Japan. 
Due to volatile demand in new ship construction and heavy invest-
ment by some licensees, there is excess capacity in the market for 
marine engines, resulting in risks ranging from a decline in license 
revenues through to bad debt losses. There is also a risk that market 
share will be lost as a result of Chinese state-owned licensees 
merging with competitors. We address these risks by constantly 
monitoring the markets, working closely together with licensees 
and carefully managing business relationships with them. This also 
includes receivables management in order to safeguard our license 
revenues. 
 
Dependence on fleet customer business  
The percentage of total registrations in Germany accounted for by 
fleet customers rose to 14.1 (13.3)% in fiscal year 2015. The 
Volkswagen Group’s share of this customer segment rose to 
48.5 (48.4)%. Registrations by fleet customers in Europe were  
11.3% higher in total than in the previous year; the Group’s share 
of this was 28.9 (29.2)%.  
The fleet customer business is generally more stable than the 
business with retail customers. In light of the emissions issue, many 
fleet customers reacted with concern. There was, however, no 
reported impact on new vehicle registrations in fleet customer busi-
ness in 2015. With clarification of the CO
2 issue and the technical 
solutions within the scope of the diesel issue, we also expect no 
significant volume decreases for the fleet customer business of the 
Volkswagen Group in 2016. The fleet customer business continues to be characterized by 
increasing concentration and internationalization. The Volkswagen 
Group is well positioned with its broad portfolio of products and 
drive systems, as well as its target-group-focused customer care. 
There is no concentration of default risks at individual fleet cus-
tomers.  
  Quality risk 
Right from the product development stage, we aim to identify and 
rectify quality problems at the earliest possible point, so as to avoid 
delays to the start of production. As we are using an increasing 
number of modular components as part of our modular toolkit 
strategy, it is very important when defects do occur to identify and 
eliminate the cause of the defect as quickly as possible. We further 
optimized the processes with which we can prevent these 
procedural defects at our brands and improved our organizational 
processes during the reporting period so that we are able to counter 
the associated risks more effectively. 
Increasing technical complexity and the use of the toolkit 
system in the Group mean that the need for high-grade supplier 
components of impeccable quality is rising. To ensure the 
continuity of production, it is also extremely important that our own 
plants and our suppliers deliver components on time. We ensure 
long-term quality and supply capability from the very start of the 
supply chain using a risk management system that we first tested 
internally and then introduced among suppliers. In this way, Quality 
Assurance helps to fulfill customer expectations and consequently 
to boost our Company’s reputation, sales figures and earnings. 
Assuring quality is of fundamental importance especially in the 
Brazilian, Russian, Indian and Chinese markets, for which we 
develop dedicated vehicles and where local manufacturers and 
suppliers have been established, particularly as it may be very 
difficult to estimate regulatory or official decisions. We continuously 
analyze the conditions specific to each market and adapt quality 
requirements to them. We counter the local risks we identify by 
continuously developing promising measures and implementing 
them locally, thereby effectively preventing quality defects from 
arising.  
Vehicle registration and operation criteria are defined and 
monitored by national and, in some cases, international authorities. 
Some countries also have special, and in some cases new, rules 
aimed at protecting customers in their dealings with vehicle 
manufacturers. With our established and revised quality assurance 
processes, we ensure that the Volkswagen Group brands and their 
products fulfill all applicable requirements and that local 
authorities receive timely notification of all issues requiring 
reporting. By doing so, we reduce the risk of customer complaints, 
administrative fines and other negative consequences.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
179 Personnel Risk 
We counter economic risks as well as changes in the market and 
competitive situation with a range of instruments that help the 
Group to remain flexible, even with fluctuating order intake  
– whether orders decline or demand for our products increases. 
These include time accounts which are filled when overtime is 
necessary and reduced through time off in quiet periods, enabling 
our factories to adjust their capacity to the production volume and to 
“breathe” with measures such as extra shifts, closure days and 
flexible shift models. The use of temporary workers also allows us to 
plan more flexibly. All of these measures help the Volkswagen 
Group to maintain a stable permanent workforce as a rule even 
when orders fluctuate.  
The technical expertise and individual commitment of employees 
are essential prerequisites for the success of the Volkswagen Group. 
Our strategic, end-to-end human resources development strategy 
gives all employees attractive training and development oppor-
tunities, with particular emphasis being placed on increasing 
technical expertise in the Company’s different vocational groups. 
By boosting our training programs, particularly at our international 
locations, we are able to adequately address the challenges of tech-
nological change. 
We are continuously expanding our recruitment tools. Our 
systematic talent relationship management, for example, enables 
us to make contact with talented candidates from strategically 
relevant target groups at an early stage and to build a long-term 
relationship between them and the Group.  
In addition to the standard dual vocational training, programs 
such as our StIP integrated degree and traineeship scheme ensure 
a pipeline of highly qualified and motivated employees. We counter 
the risk that knowledge will be lost as a result of employee fluc-
tuation and retirement with intensive, department-specific training. 
We have also expanded deployment of our base of senior experts in 
the Group. With this additional measure we use the valuable 
knowledge of our experienced specialists that retired from 
Volkswagen.  
IT Risk 
At Volkswagen, a global company geared towards further growth, 
the information technology (IT) used in all divisions Group-wide is 
assuming an increasingly important role. IT risks include unautho-
rized access to sensitive electronic corporate data as well as limited 
systems availability as a consequence of downtime or natural 
disasters.  
We address the risk of unauthorized access to corporate data 
with IT security technologies (e.g. firewall and intrusion prevention 
systems) and a dual authentication procedure. We achieve additional 
protection by restricting the allocation of access rights to systems 
and information and by keeping backup copies of critical data 
  resources. We use technical resources that have been tried and 
tested in the market, adhering to standards applicable throughout 
the Company. Redundant IT infrastructures protect us against risks 
that occur in the event of a systems failure or natural or other 
disaster. 
One of our focuses is on continuously enhancing our security 
measures. The current IT security program, for example, is built on 
structured rights management, optimization of IT infrastructure, 
application security and the IT security command center. The role 
of the latter is to detect cyber-attacks at an early stage and help to 
successfully defeat them using the latest hardware and software. 
The command center is staffed around the clock in three regions 
(Europe, America, Asia). Volkswagen complements these technical 
measures with consistent awareness raising and training for all 
employees. 
Volkswagen AG, Allianz SE,  BASF SE and Bayer AG have jointly 
founded the German cybersecurity organization, 
DCSO.  The com-
pany aims to serve as a competence center, accumulate specialist 
knowledge on cybersecurity and become the preferred service 
provider in this field to German business. 
DCSO conducts security 
audits and certifies key suppliers and technologies in order to help 
German businesses detect and defend against cyber-attacks and to 
predict them in future. It is hoped that close exchange of infor-
mation with the Federal Ministry of the Interior and the Federal 
Office for Information Security will aid the compilation of an 
anonymized status report on national cybersecurity. Small and 
medium-sized enterprises – including many of our suppliers – can 
obtain security services offered by 
DCSO, which they would 
otherwise be unable to afford. Volkswagen also benefits from this, 
as it makes our supply chain more secure. 
The high standards we set for the quality of our products also 
apply to the way in which we handle our customers’ data. Our 
guiding principles are data security and transparency as well as 
informational self-determination.  
Environmental protection regulations 
The specific emission limits for all new passenger car and light 
commercial vehicle models and the fleet targets calculated from the 
individual vehicle data for brands and groups in the 28 EU member 
states for the period up to 2019 are set out in EC Regulation No 
443/2009 on CO
2 emissions from passenger cars and EU 
Regulation No 510/2011 on light commercial vehicles of up to 3.5 
tonnes, in effect since April 2009 and June 2011 respectively. The 
regulations are an important component of European climate 
protection legislation and therefore form the key regulatory 
framework for product design and marketing by all vehicle 
manufacturers operating in the European markets. 
From 2012 onwards, the average CO
2 emissions of manu-
facturers’ new European passenger car fleets may not exceed the 
  
  ",,,,,,,,,,
211," 
  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
180  figure of 130 g CO
2/km. Compliance with this requirement was 
introduced in phases: in 2015 the entire fleet had to meet this limit. 
EU Regulation No 333/2014, which was adopted in 2014, states that, 
from 2021 onwards, the emissions of European passenger car 
fleets may be no higher than just 95 g CO
2/km.  
The EU’s CO
2 regulation for light commercial vehicles requires 
limits to be met from 2014 onwards, with targets being phased in 
over the period to 2017: the average CO
2 emissions of new vehicle 
registrations in Europe may not exceed the figure of 175 g CO
2/km, 
a target required to be met by 75% of the fleet in 2015 and 80% of 
the fleet in 2016. From 2020 onwards, the limit under EU Regu-
lation No 253/2014, which was adopted in 2014, is 147 g CO
2/km. 
Like the regulations for passenger cars, the CO
2 regulations for 
light commercial vehicles provide for exceptions to be made, for 
example by offering relief for technical innovations in the vehicle. 
The European Commission intends to define the CO
2 regime 
for the period after 2020 by the end of 2016. Politicians are already 
discussing reduction targets for the transport sector for the period 
to 2050, such as the 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
from 1990 levels cited in the EU White Paper on transport pub-
lished in March 2011. It will only be possible to meet these long-
term goals by also making extensive use of nonfossil sources of 
energy, in particular in the form of renewable electricity.  
At the same time, regulations governing fleet fuel consumption 
are also being developed or introduced outside the EU28, for 
example in India, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Switzer-
land, South Korea and Taiwan. Brazil has introduced a fleet effi-
ciency target as part of a voluntary program for granting a tax 
advantage. To achieve a 30% tax advantage, vehicle manufacturers 
are required to achieve, among other things, average fleet effi-
ciency of around 1.82 megajoules/km by 2017. The fuel con-
sumption regulations in China for the period 2012–2015 (Phase III) 
with a fleet target of 6.9 liters/100 km in the year under review, will 
progress to Phase IV for the period 2016–2020, with a target of 5.0 
liters/100 km at the end of this period. Due to the extension of 
greenhouse gas legislation in the 
USA, uniform fuel consumption 
and greenhouse gas rules will continue to apply in all states of the 
USA in the period from 2017 to 2025. The law was signed by the US 
president back in mid-2012. 
The increase in fleet-based CO
2 and consumption regulations 
means that it is necessary to use the latest mobility technologies in 
all key markets worldwide. Electrified and pure-play electric drives 
will also become increasingly common. The Volkswagen Group 
closely coordinates technology and product planning with its 
brands so as to avoid breaches of fleet fuel consumption limits, 
which would entail severe sanctions. Volkswagen continues to 
regard diesel technology as an important element in the fulfillment 
of CO
2 emissions targets. In principle, the EU legislation permits some flexibility. For example:  > Excess emissions and emission shortfalls may be offset between 
vehicle models within a fleet of new vehicles  
> Emission pools may be formed  
> Relief may be provided in the form of credits that are granted for 
additional innovative technologies (eco-innovations) contained 
in the vehicle and that apply outside the test cycle  
> Special rules are in place for small series producers and niche 
manufacturers 
> Particularly efficient vehicles qualify for super-credits. 
Whether the Group meets its targets, however, depends crucially on 
its technological and financial capabilities, which are reflected, 
among other things, in our drivetrain and fuel strategy (see page 
133). 
The European Commission and 
UNECE (United Nations Eco-
nomic Commission for Europe) are currently working to introduce 
a globally harmonized driving cycle.  
The most important European regulations also include Real 
Driving Emissions (
RDE) for passenger cars and light commercial 
vehicles. The regulation is expected to be finalized by mid-2016 and 
is intended to set limits for nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions 
in the EU effective from September 2017. These limits must be 
complied with in real road traffic. This means the RDE test pro-
cedure differs fundamentally from the Euro 6 standard still in force, 
which stipulates that the limits are compulsory for testing. The RDE 
regulation is intended primarily to improve air quality in urban 
areas and areas close to traffic. It will lead to stricter requirements 
for exhaust gas aftertreatment for passenger cars and light com-
mercial vehicles. 
The other main EU regulations affecting the automotive 
industry include  
> EU Directive 2007/46/EC establishing a framework for the 
approval of motor vehicles  
> EU Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-
efficient road transport vehicles (Green Procurement Directive) 
> EU Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from air-
conditioning systems in motor vehicles  
> The Passenger car energy consumption labeling Directive 
1999/94/EC  
> The Fuel Quality Directive ( FQD) 2009/30/EC updating the fuel 
quality specifications and introducing energy efficiency 
specifications for fuel production  
> The Renewable Energy Directive ( RED) 2009/28/EC introducing 
sustainability criteria  
> The Revised Energy Taxation Directive 2003/96/EC updating the 
minimum tax rates for all energy products and power.

181 The implementation of the above-mentioned directives by the EU 
member states serves to support the CO
2 regulations in Europe. As 
well as vehicle manufacturers, they are also aimed at the mineral oil 
industry, for example. Vehicle taxes based on CO
2 emissions are 
having a similar steering effect; many EU member states have 
already incorporated CO
2 elements into their rules on vehicle 
taxation. 
Heavy commercial vehicles first put into operation from 2014 
onwards are already subject to the stricter emission requirements 
under the Euro 6 standard in accordance with EU Regulation No 
582/2011. The EU is also preparing a further CO
2 regulation for 
heavy commercial vehicles at the same time as the CO
2 legislation 
for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Simply setting an 
overarching limit for these vehicles – like that in place for pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles – is just one option for 
these vehicles and would require an extremely complex set of rules 
because of the wide range of variants. With the support of 
independent scientific institutions and the European Automobile 
Manufacturers’ Association 
(ACEA), the European Commission is 
currently preparing a simulation-based method called 
VECTO 
(Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool), which can be used 
to determine the CO
2 emissions of heavy commercial vehicles of 
over 7.5 tonnes based on their typical use (short-haul, regional, 
distribution and long-haul trips, service on construction sites and 
as municipal vehicles, city buses, intercity buses and coaches). This 
method is expected to be the basis for the European Commission’s 
concrete regulatory proposals, which are anticipated during 2016. 
Probably starting 2018 (2019 at the latest), a CO
2 declaration is 
expected to be compulsory for selected vehicle categories (initially 
long-haul and regional distribution vehicles, later also buses and 
other segments), with the captured data initially being used for 
customer information allowing comparability, for certification and 
for monitoring purposes. Further vehicle categories are likely to be 
included as time progresses. 
Manufacturers of heavy commercial vehicles are urging the 
adoption of a system for quantifying CO
2 figures that is accessible to 
everyone and that looks at the vehicle as a whole and not simply at 
the engine or the tractor, but also at the trailers and bodywork. This 
transparency should increase competition for fuel and thus CO
2-
efficient commercial vehicles and as a result decrease CO
2 emis-
sions.  
As part of its efforts to reduce the CO
2 emissions of heavy com-
mercial vehicles, the European Commission has also adjusted the 
provisions regarding the maximum permissible dimensions and 
weights of trucks (Directive 1996/53/EC, the Weights and Dimen-
sions Directive) and revised them through EU Directive 2015/719. 
As a consequence, cabs with a rounded shape and aerodynamic 
devices at the rear of the vehicle will enable future improvements in 
aerodynamics. At the same time, the driver’s field of vision will be 
extended by increasing the length of the cab in  
  order to improve safety. In addition, the legislators increased the 
overall weight permitted for vehicles with alternative drive 
technologies by up to one tonne. The specific technical require-
ments for the development of aerodynamic and safer cabs have not 
yet been decided and will only be defined in the next two years.  
The European commercial vehicles industry supports the goals 
of reducing CO 2 emissions and improving transport safety. However, 
it is not just new vehicles that matter for future CO
2 emissions; 
individual components are also important, such as reduced rolling 
resistance tires and the aerodynamic trim of the trailer, as are 
driving behavior, alternative fuels, transport infrastructure and 
transport conditions. Longer, heavier vehicles that can decrease 
fuel consumption and thus CO
2 emissions by up to 25% according 
to scientific studies by the Federal Highway Research Institute are 
currently also driving on German roads in a field trial. 
In the Power Engineering segment, the International Maritime 
Organization 
(IMO) has implemented the International Convention 
for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (
MARPOL – MARine 
POLlution), with which limits on emissions from marine engines 
will be reduced in phases. Emission limits also apply, for example, 
under EU Directive 1997/68/EC and in accordance with the regu-
lations of the US 
EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). As regards 
stationary equipment, there are a number of national rules in place 
worldwide that limit permitted emissions. On December 18, 2008, 
the World Bank Group set limits for gas and diesel engines in its 
“Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for Thermal Power 
Plants”, which are required to be applied if individual countries 
have adopted no or less strict national requirements. In addition, 
back in 1979, the United Nations adopted the Convention on Long-
range Transboundary Air Pollution, setting limits on total emissions 
as well as nitrogen oxide limits for the signatory states (including all 
EU states, other countries in Eastern Europe, the 
USA and Canada). 
Enhancements to the product portfolio in the Power Engineering 
segment focus on improving the efficiency of the equipment and 
systems. 
The allocation method for emissions certificates changed 
fundamentally when the third emissions trading period (2013–
2020) began. As a general rule, all emission allowances for power 
generators have been sold at auction starting in 2013. For manu-
facturing industry and certain power generation installations (e.g. 
combined heat and power installations), a portion of the certificates 
are allocated free of charge on the basis of benchmarks applicable 
throughout the EU. The portion of certificates allocated free of 
charge will gradually decrease as the trading period progresses: the 
remaining quantities required will have to be bought, and thus paid 
for, at auction. Furthermore, installation operators can partly fulfill 
their obligation to hold emission allowances using certificates from 
climate protection projects (Joint Implementation and Clean 
Development Mechanism projects).

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
182  In certain (sub-)sectors of industry, there is a risk that production 
will be transferred to countries outside Europe due to the amended 
provisions governing emissions trading (a phenomenon referred to 
as “carbon leakage”). In these cases a consistent quantity of 
certificates will be allocated free of charge for the period from 2013 
to 2020 on the basis of the pan-EU benchmarks. The automotive 
industry was included in the new carbon leakage list that came into 
effect in 2015. It is still unclear to what extent the Volkswagen Group 
will receive additional certificates free of charge. 
In 2013, the European Commission decided to initially with-
hold a portion of the certificates to be auctioned and to only release 
them for auction at a later date during the third trading period 
(backloading). This temporary scarcity of certificates, which could 
lead to a price increase, will be directed into a market stability 
reserve, to be established in 2018. The reserve should in future 
correct any imbalance between the supply of and demand for 
certificates in emissions trading.  
As well as the European Union, other countries in which the 
Volkswagen Group has production sites are also considering intro-
ducing an emissions trading system. Seven pilot projects are 
running in China, for example, although they have not so far 
affected the Volkswagen Group. The Chinese government plans to 
expand those pilot projects into a national emissions trading system.  
Litigation 
In the course of their operating activities, Volkswagen AG and the 
companies in which it is directly or indirectly invested become 
involved in a great number of legal disputes and official proceedings 
in Germany and internationally. In particular, such legal disputes 
and other proceedings may occur in relation to suppliers, dealers, 
customers, employees, or investors. For the companies involved, 
these may result in payment or other obligations. Above all in cases 
where US customers in particular assert claims for vehicle defects 
individually or by way of a class action, highly cost-intensive mea-
sures may have to be taken and substantial compensation or 
punitive damages paid. Corresponding risks also result from US 
patent infringement proceedings.  
Risks may also emerge in connection with the adherence to 
regulatory requirements. This particularly applies in the case of 
regulatory vagueness that may be interpreted differently by Volks-
wagen and the agencies responsible for the respective regulations. 
In addition, legal risks can arise from the criminal activities of 
individual persons, which even the best compliance system can 
never completely prevent. 
Where transparent and economically viable, adequate 
insurance cover is taken out for these risks. For the identifiable and 
measurable risks, appropriate provisions are recognized and  
  information about contingent liabilities is disclosed. As some risks 
cannot be assessed or can only be assessed to a limited extent, the 
possibility of loss or damage not being covered by the insured 
amounts and provisions cannot be ruled out. This particularly 
applies to legal risk assessment regarding the diesel issue. 
  Diesel Issue  
On September 18, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
(
EPA) publicly announced in a “Notice of Violation” that irregu-
larities in relation to nitrogen oxide (NO
x) emissions had been 
discovered in emissions tests on certain vehicles with Volkswagen 
Group diesel engines. It has been alleged that we had used 
undisclosed engine management software installed in certain four-
cylinder diesel engines used in certain 2009 to 2015 model year 
vehicles to circumvent NO
x emissions testing regulations in the 
United States of America in order to comply with certification 
requirements. The US environmental authority of California – the 
California Air Resources Board 
(CARB) – announced its own 
enforcement investigation in this context. 
Volkswagen admitted to irregularities in this context. In its ad 
hoc release dated September 22, 2015, the Volkswagen Group 
announced that noticeable discrepancies between the figures 
achieved in testing and in actual road use had been identified in 
around eleven million vehicles worldwide with certain diesel 
engines. The vast majority of these engines are Type EA 189 Euro 5 
engines. On November 2, 2015, the 
EPA issued another “Notice of 
Violation” alleging that irregularities had also been discovered in 
the software installed in vehicles with type V6 
TDI 3.0 l diesel 
engines. 
CARB also issued a letter announcing its own enforcement 
investigation in this context. Audi has confirmed that a total of three 
auxiliary emission control devices were inadequately disclosed in 
the course of the US approval documentation. Around 113 
thousand vehicles from the 2009 to 2016 model years with certain 
six-cylinder diesel engines are affected. 
On January 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (
DOJ), on 
behalf of the EPA, filed a civil complaint against Volkswagen AG, 
AUDI AG and other companies of the Volkswagen Group. The claims 
asserted under civil law are founded on the alleged use of illegal 
(Defeat Device) software in violation of the American Clean Air Act. 
The complaint’s allegations relate to both the four-cylinder and the 
six-cylinder diesel engines. On January 12, 2016, it was announced 
that 
CARB intends to seek civil fines for alleged violations of the 
California Health & Safety Code and various 
CARB regulations.  
The allegations described are subject to extensive ongoing 
discussions between Volkswagen and the 
EPA or CARB, respectively, 
also including a rigorous review of relevant technical concepts. The 
investigations have not been completed at the present time.  ",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
183 In addition to internal inquiries, Volkswagen AG commissioned an 
official external investigation by US law firm Jones Day for this 
purpose. This will be an independent and comprehensive 
investigation that will address the diesel issue. The Supervisory 
Board of Volkswagen AG is ensuring that Jones Day can carry out its 
clarification work independently. Jones Day is updating the 
Company on the current results of its investigation on an ongoing 
basis. 
The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG has formed a special 
committee to coordinate all activities in this context for the Super-
visory Board. 
Based on decisions dated October 15, 2015, the Kraftfahrt-
bundesamt (
KBA – German Federal Motor Transport Authority) 
ordered the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial 
Vehicles and SEAT brands to recall all of the diesel vehicles that had 
been issued with vehicle type approval by the KBA from among the 
11 million affected. The recall concerns the member states of the 
European Union (EU28). On December 10, 2015 a similar decision 
was issued regarding Audi vehicles with the EA 189 engine. The 
timetable and action plan forming the basis for the recall order 
correspond to the proposals presented in advance by Volkswagen. 
Depending on the technical complexity of the remedial actions, this 
means that Volkswagen has been recalling the affected vehicles, of 
which there are around 8.5 million in total in the EU 28 countries, 
to the service workshops since January 2016. Based on current 
knowledge, the remedial actions differ in scope depending on the 
engine variant. The technical solutions cover software and in some 
cases hardware modifications, depending on the series and model 
year. The details of the remedial actions will be agreed in close 
cooperation with the KBA, which must approve them in advance. 
Discussions are currently underway with the authorities in the 
other EU member states with the aim of ensuring that no legal 
actions above and beyond this will be taken in this connection by 
public authorities in the other member states. The Group brands 
SEAT and ŠKODA also received approvals in principle each from 
their respective type approval authorities – the Ministry of Industry 
in Spain and the Vehicle Certification Agency in the United King-
dom. In some countries outside the EU – among others Switzerland, 
Australia and Turkey – national type approval is based on prior re-
cognition of the 
EC/ECE type approval. We are also in close contact 
with the authorities in these countries in order to coordinate the 
corresponding actions.  
In addition, there is an intensive exchange of information with 
the authorities in the USA and Canada, where Volkswagen’s 
planned actions in relation to the four-cylinder and the six-cylinder 
diesel engines will also have to be approved. Due to considerably 
stricter NO
x limits in the  USA, it is a greater technical challenge to 
refit the vehicles so that all applicable emissions limits can be met. Potential consequences for Volkswagen’s results of operations, 
financial position and net assets could emerge primarily in the 
following legal areas: 
 
1. Criminal and administrative proceedings all over the world 
(excluding the  USA/Canada) 
In addition to the approval processes with the responsible regis-
tration authorities, criminal investigations/misdemeanour pro-
ceedings have been opened (for example, by the public prosecutor’s 
office in Braunschweig, Germany) and/or administrative pro-
ceedings have been announced in some countries (for example, by 
the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht BaFin – the 
German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority). The public 
prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig is investigating the core issue of 
the criminal investigations. Whether this will result in fines for the 
Company, and if so what their amount might be, is currently subject 
to estimation risks. According to Volkswagen’s estimates so far, the 
large majority of proceedings have less than a 50% probability of 
success. Contingent liabilities have therefore been disclosed in 
cases where they can be assessed and for which the chance of 
success was deemed not implausible.  
 
2. Product-related lawsuits worldwide (excluding the 
USA/Canada) 
In principle, it is possible that customers in the affected markets 
will file civil lawsuits against Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen 
Group companies. In addition, it is possible that importers and 
dealers could assert claims against Volkswagen AG and other 
Volkswagen Group companies, e.g. through recourse claims. As 
well as individual lawsuits, class action lawsuits are possible in 
various jurisdictions (albeit not in Germany).  
In this context, various lawsuits are pending against Volks-
wagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies at present. 
Class action proceedings against Volkswagen AG and other 
Volkswagen Group companies are pending in various countries 
such as Australia, Israel, Italy, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. 
The proceedings in the Netherlands are focused on taking evidence 
only. The other class action proceedings are lawsuits aimed among 
other things at asserting damages. The amount of these damages 
cannot yet be quantified due to the early stage of the proceedings. In 
South Korea various mass proceedings are pending (individual 
lawsuits in which several hundred litigants have aggregated). These 
lawsuits are filed to assert damages and to rescind the purchase 
contract including repayment of the purchase price. Volkswagen 
does not estimate the litigants’ prospect of success to be more than 
50% in any of the aforementioned proceedings aimed at asserting 
damages. Contingent liabilities have therefore been disclosed in 
those cases where that can be assessed and for which the chance of 
success was deemed not implausible. 
  ",,,,,,,,,,

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
184  Furthermore, individual lawsuits and similar proceedings are 
pending against Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group com-
panies in numerous countries. In Germany and Austria, individual 
lawsuits in the two-digit range are pending, most of which are 
aimed at asserting damages or rescinding the purchase contract. 
According to Volkswagen’s estimates so far, the litigants’ prospect of 
success is below 50% in the vast majority of the individual lawsuits. 
Contingent liabilities have therefore been disclosed for those 
lawsuits that can be assessed and for which the chance of success 
was deemed not implausible. 
It is too early to estimate how many customers will take advan-
tage of the option to file lawsuits in the future, beyond the existing 
lawsuits, or what their prospects of success will be. On the one hand, 
the final results of the external investigation by Jones Day are not yet 
known. On the other hand, the public prosecutors’ investigations 
are also still ongoing.  
Volkswagen is working intensively to finalize the remedial 
actions described above. For the 2 l engines, implementation 
already started in the fourth week of January 2016.  
Volkswagen is pursuing the clear aim of not adversely affecting 
engine performance, fuel consumption and CO
2 emissions in 
implementing the planned measures. 
3. Lawsuits filed by investors worldwide (excluding the 
USA/Canada) 
Investors from Germany and abroad have announced that they are 
examining the possibility of pursuing claims for damages against 
Volkswagen AG due to the movements in Volkswagen AG’s share 
price following publication of the EPA’s “Notices of Violation”. 
Volkswagen AG had already been served with lawsuits that in 
particular claim damages due to alleged misconduct in capital 
market communications. In some cases, applications were simulta-
neously made to instigate proceedings in accordance with the 
Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetz (Capital Markets Model 
Case Act). Volkswagen is of the opinion that it duly complied with its 
capital market obligations. Therefore, no provisions have been 
recognized. Furthermore, contingent liabilities were disclosed for a 
portion of the submitted claims. The majority of the claims either 
could not be assessed at the time or the chance of success was 
deemed unlikely. 
 
4. Proceedings in the 
USA/Canada 
Following the publication of the 
EPA’s notices of violation, Volks-
wagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies have been the 
subject of intense scrutiny, ongoing investigations (civil and 
criminal) and civil litigation. Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen 
Group companies have received subpoenas and inquiries from 
state attorneys general and other governmental authorities and are 
responding to such investigations and inquiries.  In addition, Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group com-
panies in the  USA/Canada are facing litigation on a number of 
different fronts relating to the matters described in the 
EPA’s 
“Notices of Violation”.  
On January 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (
DOJ), Civil 
Division, on behalf of the 
EPA, initiated a civil penalty lawsuit 
against Volkswagen AG, 
AUDI AG and certain other Volkswagen 
Group companies. The action seeks statutory penalties under the 
US Clean Air Act, as well as certain injunctive relief. 
On January 12, 2016, it was announced that 
CARB intends to 
seek civil fines for alleged violations of the California Health & 
Safety Code and various 
CARB regulations. 
The 
DOJ has also opened a criminal investigation. This focuses 
on allegations that various federal law criminal offenses were 
committed. 
A large number of putative class action lawsuits by affected 
customers and dealers have been filed in US federal courts and 
consolidated for pretrial coordination purposes in a federal court 
multidistrict litigation proceeding in the State of California. The 
claims primarily relate to compensation for material damage. The 
DOJ civil penalty lawsuit referenced above has also been con-
solidated for pretrial coordination purposes in this California 
multidistrict litigation proceeding. 
Additionally, in the 
USA, some putative class actions have been 
filed; some individual customers’ lawsuits have been filed; and 
some state or municipal claims have been filed in state courts. The 
attorneys general of four US states (West Virginia, Texas, New 
Mexico and New Jersey) have commenced litigation in state courts 
and allege that Volkswagen Group of America inappropriately 
advertised clean diesels and that customers were misled into 
purchasing Volkswagen diesel vehicles as a result. The United States 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also made similar accusations 
against the Volkswagen Group of America in its lawsuit from  
March 29, 2016. 
In addition to lawsuits described above, for which provisions 
have been recognized, a number of lawsuits for damages have been 
filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of Volkswagen AG 
American Depository Receipts, alleging a suffered drop in price 
purportedly resulting from the matters described in the 
EPA’s 
""Notices of Violation"". 
These lawsuits have also been consolidated in the federal 
multidistrict litigation proceeding in the State of California 
described above. Volkswagen is of the opinion that it duly complied 
with its capital market obligations. Therefore, no provisions have 
been recognized. In addition, contingent liabilities have not been 
disclosed as they currently cannot be measured.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
185 5. Risk assessment regarding the diesel issue 
To protect against the currently known legal risks, including 
suitable expenses for defense and legal advice related to the diesel 
issue, existing information and assessments at the time indicated 
the need to generate provisions in the amount of €7.0 billion. A sum 
amounting to €1 billion has also been reported for contingent 
liabilities, insofar as these can be adequately measured at this stage. 
The provisions recognized, the contingent liabilities disclosed and 
the other latent legal risks are partially subject to substantial 
estimation risks given the complexity of the individual factors, the 
ongoing regulatory approval process with the authorities and the 
fact that the independent and exhaustive investigations have not yet 
been completed. In addition, negotiations are currently being 
conducted with the authorities in the USA concerning possible 
investments in environmental projects and e-mobility. The 
investments are expected to amount to approximately €1.8 billion. 
Their content and timing have yet to be defined. 
 
Additional important legal cases 
ARFB Anlegerschutz UG (haftungsbeschränkt), Berlin, brought an 
action against Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Stuttgart, Germany, 
and Volkswagen AG for claims for damages allegedly assigned to it 
in the amount of approximately €2.26 billion. The plaintiff asserts 
that these claims are based on alleged breaches by the defendants 
of legislation to protect the capital markets in connection with 
Porsche’s acquisition of Volkswagen shares in 2008. With its April 
2016 ruling, the district court of Hannover submitted numerous 
goals for discovery to the higher regional court in Celle in an 
attempt to prompt a model case decision. In all other cases, the 
claims were thrown out for being inadmissible. In various cases 
since 2010, investors initiated conciliation proceedings for other 
alleged damages – including claims against Volkswagen AG – that 
amounted to approximately €4.6 billion in total and also related to 
transactions at that time. In each case, Volkswagen rejected the 
claims asserted and refused to participate in any conciliation 
proceedings. 
In 2011, the European Commission opened antitrust pro-
ceedings against European truck manufacturers including 
MAN 
and Scania. In November 2014, the European Commission sent a 
statement of objections to 
MAN, Scania and the other truck manu-
facturers concerned, in which it informed the truck manufacturers 
of the objections raised against them and gave them the right to 
comment extensively on the objections raised and to exercise other 
rights of defense before any decision is reached. Given the fact that 
the issues are still being clarified, it is too early to judge whether the 
European Commission’s investigation will result in financial 
  liabilities for  MAN and Scania and, if so, to assess their amount. As a 
consequence, neither 
MAN nor Scania has recognized provisions or 
disclosed contingent liabilities. 
The Annual General Meeting of 
MAN SE approved the con-
clusion of a control and profit and loss transfer agreement between 
MAN SE and Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH (formerly Truck & Bus 
GmbH), a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, in June 2013. In July 2013, 
award proceedings were instituted to review the appropriateness of 
the cash settlement set out in the agreement in accordance with 
section 305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation 
Act) and the cash compensation in accordance with section 304 of 
the AktG. It is not uncommon for noncontrolling interest share-
holders to institute such proceedings. In July 2015, the Munich 
Regional Court ruled in the first instance that the amount of the 
cash settlement payable to the noncontrolling interest shareholders 
of 
MAN should be increased from €80.89 to €90.29; at the same 
time, the amount of the cash compensation was confirmed. Both 
applicants and Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH have appealed to the 
Higher Regional Court in Munich. Volkswagen continues to main-
tain that the results of the valuation are correct. The appropriate-
ness of the valuation was confirmed by the audit firms engaged by 
the parties and by the court-appointed auditor of the agreement. 
The assessment of liability for put options and compensation rights 
granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders was adjusted in 
turn. 
In line with IAS 37.92, no further statements have been made 
concerning estimates of financial impact or about uncertainty 
regarding the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent 
liabilities, particularly in relation to the diesel issue and the Euro-
pean Commission’s investigation. This is so as to not compromise 
the results of the proceedings or the interests of the Company.  
Strategies for hedging financial risks 
In the course of our business activities, financial risks may arise 
from changes in interest rates, exchange rates, raw materials prices, 
or share and fund prices. Management of financial and liquidity 
risks is the responsibility of the central Group Treasury department, 
which minimizes these risks using nonderivative and derivative 
financial instruments. The Board of Management is informed of 
the current risk situation at regular intervals. 
We hedge interest rate risk – where appropriate in combination 
with currency risk – and risks arising from fluctuations in the value 
of financial instruments by means of interest rate swaps, cross-
currency swaps and other interest rate contracts with funda-
mentally matching amounts and maturities. This also applies to 
financing arrangements within the Volkswagen Group.  
  ",,,,,,,,,,
217," 
  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities 
186  Foreign currency risk is reduced in particular through natural 
hedging, i.e. by flexibly adapting our production capacity at our 
locations around the world, establishing new production facilities 
in the most important currency regions and also procuring a large 
percentage of components locally. We hedge the residual foreign 
currency risk using hedging instruments. These include currency 
forwards, currency options and cross-currency swaps. We use these 
transactions to limit the currency risk associated with forecasted 
cash flows from operating activities and intragroup financing in 
currencies other than the respective functional currency. The 
currency forwards and currency options can have a term of up to six 
years. We thus hedge our principal foreign currency risks, mostly 
against the euro and primarily in Australian dollars, Brazilian real, 
sterling, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupees, Japanese yen, Canadian 
dollars, Mexican pesos, Polish zloty, Russian rubles, Swedish 
kronor, Swiss francs, Singapore dollars, South African rand, South 
Korean won, Taiwan dollars, Czech koruna, Hungarian forints and 
US dollars.  
Increased volatility in future cash flows is to be expected from 
the current uncertainties regarding the effects of the emissions 
issue on the Volkswagen Group. This could impact the hedging 
result.  
Raw materials purchasing entails risks relating to the 
availability of raw materials and price trends. We limit these risks 
mainly by entering into forward transactions and swaps. We have 
used appropriate contracts to hedge some of our requirements for 
commodities such as aluminum, lead, coal, copper, platinum, 
palladium and rhodium over a period of up to seven years. Similar 
transactions have been entered into for the purpose of supple-
menting and improving allocations of CO
2 emission certificates.  
Pages 278 to 286 of the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements explain our hedging policy, the hedging rules and the 
default and liquidity risks, and quantify the hedging transactions 
mentioned. Additionally, we disclose information on market risk 
within the meaning of 
IFRS 7. 
Risks arising from financial instruments 
Channeling excess liquidity into investments and entering into 
derivatives contracts gives rise to counterparty risk. Partial or 
complete failure by counterparty to perform its obligation to pay 
interest and repay principal, for example, would have a negative 
 impact on the Volkswagen Group’s earnings and liquidity. We 
counter this risk through our counterparty risk management, 
 which we describe in more detail in the section entitled “Principles 
and Goals of Financial Management” starting on page 113. In 
addition to counterparty risk, the financial instruments held for 
hedging purposes hedge balance sheet risks, which we limit by 
applying hedge accounting.  
By diversifying when we invest excess liquidity and by entering 
into financial instruments for hedging purposes, we ensure that the 
impact of a default is limited and the Volkswagen Group remains 
solvent at all times, even in the event of a default by individual 
counterparties. 
Risks arising from trade receivables and from financial services 
are explained in more detail in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, starting on page 278.  Liquidity risk 
We ensure that the Company remains solvent at all times by holding 
liquidity reserves, through confirmed credit lines and through our 
money market and capital market programs. We cover the capital 
requirements of the financial services business mainly by raising 
funds at matching maturities in the national and international 
financial markets as well as through customer deposits from the 
direct banking business.  
Projects are financed by, among other things, loans provided by 
development banks such as the European Investment Bank 
(EIB), 
the International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) and the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD), or by national 
development banks such as Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) 
and Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social 
(BNDES). Lines of credit from banks supplement our broadly 
diversified refinancing structure. 
Our ability to use refinancing instruments may possibly be 
restricted in the future or precluded for existing instruments due to 
the current uncertainties regarding the effects of the emissions 
issue on the Volkswagen Group. A downgrade of the Company’s 
rating could adversely affect the terms associated with the Volks-
wagen Group’s borrowings.

Financial Services AG and Volkswagen Bank GmbH can be found on

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Report on Risks and Opportunities  
187 Residual value risk in the financial services business 
In the financial services business, we agree to buy back selected 
vehicles at a residual value that is fixed at inception of the contract. 
Residual values are set at a realistic amount so that we are able to 
leverage market opportunities. We evaluate the underlying lease 
contracts at regular intervals and recognize any necessary pro-
visions if we identify any potential risks. 
Management of the residual value risk is based on a defined 
feedback loop ensuring the full assessment, monitoring, manage-
ment and communication of risks. This process design ensures not 
only professional management of residual risks but also that we 
systematically improve and enhance our handling of residual value 
risks. 
As part of our risk management, we use residual value forecasts 
to regularly assess the appropriateness of the provisions for risks 
and the potential for residual value risk – also with a view to the 
emissions issue. In the process, we compare the contractually 
agreed residual values with the fair values obtainable. These are 
determined utilizing data from external service providers and our 
own marketing data. We do not take account of the upside in 
residual market values when making provisions for risks. 
More information on residual value risk and other risks in the 
financial services business, such as counterparty, market and 
liquidity risk, can be found in the 2015 Annual Report of Volks-
wagen Financial Services AG.  
 Reputational risks 
The reputation of the Volkswagen Group and its brands is one of the 
most important assets and forms the basis for long-term business 
success. Our policy on issues such as ethics and sustainability is in 
the public focus. One of the basic principles of running our busi-
ness is therefore to pay particular attention to compliance with legal requirements and ethical principles. However, we are aware that 
misconduct or criminal acts of individuals and the resulting 
reputational damage can never be fully prevented. In addition, 
media reactions can have a negative effect on the reputation of the 
Volkswagen Group and its brands. This impact could be amplified 
through insufficient communication. 
Moreover, the above-described individual risks that may arise 
in the course of our operating activities may turn into a threat to the 
Volkswagen Group’s reputation.   Other factors 
Going beyond the risks already outlined, there are other factors that 
cannot be predicted and whose repercussions are therefore 
difficult to control. Should these transpire, they could have an 
adverse effect on the further development of the Volkswagen Group. 
In particular, these factors include natural disasters, epidemics and 
terror attacks. 
 
OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY POSITION  
The Volkswagen Group’s overall risk and opportunity position 
results from the specific risks and opportunities shown above. We 
have put in place a comprehensive risk management system to 
ensure that these risks are controlled. The most significant risks to 
the Group may result from a negative trend in unit sales of, and 
markets for, vehicles and genuine parts, from the failure to develop 
and produce products in line with demand and from quality 
problems. Compared with the previous year, the emissions issue 
gives rise to additional risks for the Volkswagen Group which, when 
aggregated, are among the most significant risks. Taking into 
account all the information known to us at present, no risks exist 
which could pose a threat to the continued existence of significant 
Group companies or the Volkswagen Group. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This annual report contains forward-looking statements on the business development of 
the Volkswagen Group. These statements are based on assumptions relating to the 
development of the economic and legal environment in individual countries and economic 
regions, and in particular for the automotive industry, which we have made on the basis of 
the information available to us and which we consider to be realistic at the time of going 
to press. The estimates given entail a degree of risk, and actual developments may differ 
from those forecast. Any changes in significant parameters relating to our key sales markets, or any significant shifts in exchange rates relevant to the Volkswagen Group, will 
have a corresponding effect on the development of our business. In addition, there may be 
departures from our expected business development if the assessments of the factors 
influencing sustainable value enhancement, as well as risks and opportunities, presented 
in this annual report develop in a way other than we are currently expecting, or if 
additional risks and opportunities or other factors emerge that affect the development of 
our business.

  GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Prospects for 2016 
188  The Volkswagen Group’s Board of Management expects the global 
economy to record the same level of growth in 2016 as in the 
previous year. Risks will arise from turbulence in the financial 
markets and structural deficits in individual countries. In addition, 
growth prospects continue to be hurt by geopolitical tensions and 
conflicts. We expect the economic upturn to continue in most 
industrialized nations, with moderate rates of expansion overall. As 
in the previous year, growth will in all probability be muted in many 
emerging markets. We expect the strongest rates of expansion in 
Asia’s emerging economies. 
We expect trends in the passenger car markets in the individual 
regions to be mixed in 2016. Overall, growth in global demand for 
new vehicles will probably be slower than in the reporting period. 
We anticipate that the demand volume in Western Europe and the 
Germany passenger car market will be in line with the previous year. 
In the Central and Eastern European markets, demand for 
passenger cars is estimated to be under the weak prior-year figure. 
In North America, we expect last year’s positive trend to continue at 
a slightly weaker pace. The volumes of the South American markets 
will probably fall noticeably short of the prior-year figures. The 
passenger car markets in the Asia-Pacific region look set to 
continue their growth path at a similar pace. 
Global demand for light commercial vehicles will probably see a 
slight increase in 2016. We expect trends to vary from region to 
region. 
In the markets for mid-sized and heavy trucks that are relevant 
for the Volkswagen Group, new registrations in 2016 are set to drop 
slightly below the prior-year level, while new registrations of buses 
in the relevant markets will probably be noticeably lower than in the 
previous year. 
We expect automotive financial services to continue to grow in 
importance worldwide in 2016.  
The Volkswagen Group is well positioned to deal with the mixed 
developments in the global automotive markets. Our broad, 
selectively expanded product range featuring the latest generation 
of engines as well as a variety of alternative drives puts us in a good 
position globally compared with our competitors. The Group’s 
strengths include in particular its unique brand portfolio, its steadily growing presence in all major world markets and its wide 
selection of financial services. Our range of models spans from 
motorcycles through compact, sports and luxury cars to heavy 
trucks and buses, and covers almost all segments. The Volkswagen 
Group’s brands will press ahead with their product initiative in 
2016, modernizing and expanding their offering by introducing 
new models. Our goal is to offer all customers the mobility and 
innovations they need, sustainably strengthening our competitive 
position in the process. 
We expect that, on the whole, deliveries to customers of the 
Volkswagen Group in 2016 will be on a level with the previous year 
amid persistently challenging market conditions, with a growing 
volume in China. 
In addition to the emissions issue, the highly competitive 
environment as well as interest rate and exchange rate volatility and 
fluctuations in raw materials prices all pose challenges. We antici-
pate positive effects from the efficiency programs implemented by 
all brands and from the modular toolkits. 
Depending on the economic conditions – particularly in South 
America and Russia – and the exchange rate development and in 
light of the emissions issue, we expect 2016 sales revenue for the 
Volkswagen Group to be down by as much as 5% on the prior-year 
figure. In terms of the Group’s operating result, we anticipate that 
the operating return on sales will be between 5.0% and 6.0% in 
2016.  
In the Passenger Cars Business Area we expect a sharp decrease 
in sales revenue, with an operating return on sales in the antici-
pated range of 5.5 – 6.5%. With sales revenue in the Commercial 
Vehicles Business Area remaining essentially unchanged, we 
assume operating return on sales will be between 2.0% and 4.0%. 
We expect sales revenue in the Power Engineering Business Area to 
be perceptibly lower than the prior-year figure, with a significantly 
reduced operating result. For the Financial Services Division, we 
are forecasting sales revenue and operating result at the prior-year 
level. Disciplined cost and investment management and the 
continuous optimization of our processes are integral elements of 
the Volkswagen Group’s strategy.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
201  OF THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 
Basis of presentation 
Volkswagen AG is domiciled in Wolfsburg, Germany, and entered in the commercial register at the Braunschweig Local 
Court under No. 
HRB 100484. The fiscal year corresponds to the calendar year. 
In accordance with Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Volkswagen AG 
prepared its consolidated financial statements for 2015 in compliance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (
IFRSs), as adopted by the European Union. We have complied with all the  IFRSs adopted by the EU and 
required to be applied.  
The accounting policies applied in the previous year were retained, with the exception of the changes due to the new or 
amended standards. 
In addition, we have complied with all the provisions of German commercial law that we are also required to apply, as 
well as with the German Corporate Governance Code. For information on notices and disclosures of changes regarding the 
ownership of voting rights in Volkswagen AG in accordance with the Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG – German Securi-
ties Trading Act), please refer to the annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG. 
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in euros. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are given in 
millions of euros (€ million). 
All figures shown are rounded, so minor discrepancies may arise from addition of these amounts. 
The income statement was prepared using the internationally accepted cost of sales method. 
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the above-mentioned standards requires 
management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of certain items in the consolidated balance sheet and in 
the consolidated income statement, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The consolidated 
financial statements present fairly the net assets, financial position and results of operations as well as the cash flows of the 
Volkswagen Group. 
The Board of Management completed preparation of the consolidated financial statements on April 22, 2016. On that 
date, the period ended in which adjusting events after the reporting period are recognized.  
Effects of new and amended IFRSs 
Volkswagen AG has adopted all accounting pronouncements required to be applied starting in fiscal year 2015.  
A number of amendments to International Financial Reporting Standards resulting from the Annual Improvements 
Project 2013 became effective on January 1, 2015. These relate to changes to 
IFRS 1, IFRS 3, IFRS 13 and IAS 40, and do 
not materially affect the Volkswagen Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations. 
IFRIC 21 has also been required to be applied since January 1, 2015.  IFRIC 21 governs the accounting for levies that 
do not fall within the scope of 
IAS 12 “Income Taxes”. In particular, it provides guidance on when a liability has to be 
recognized for payment of a levy. This Interpretation also does not materially affect the Volkswagen Group’s net assets, 
financial position and results of operations.

Key events 
On September 18, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) publicly announced in a “Notice of Violation” 
that irregularities in relation to nitrogen oxide (NO
x) emissions had been discovered in emissions tests on certain vehicles 
with Volkswagen Group diesel engines. It has been alleged that we had used undisclosed engine management software 
installed in certain four-cylinder diesel engines used in certain 2009 to 2015 model year vehicles to circumvent NO
x 
emissions testing regulations in the United States of America in order to comply with certification requirements. The US 
environmental authority of California – the California Air Resources Board (
CARB) – announced its own enforcement 
investigation in this context. Following these announcements by 
EPA and CARB, authorities in various other jurisdictions 
worldwide commenced their own investigations. 
In its ad hoc release dated September 22, 2015, the Volkswagen Group announced that there were discrepancies in 
relation to NO
x emissions figures in vehicles with type EA 189 four-cylinder diesel engines. Around eleven million vehicles 
worldwide were affected. This is attributable to the engine management software. The vehicles remain technically safe and 
ready to drive. 
Technical solutions have been prepared for the three European variants of the type EA 189 engine affected. These 
solutions have been approved in principle by the German Kraftfahrtbundesamt (German Federal Motor Transport 
Authority) for Volkswagen AG and 
AUDI AG. The Group brands  SEAT and ŠKODA also received approvals in principle each 
from their respective type approval authorities – the Ministry of Industry in Spain and the Vehicle Certification Agency in 
the United Kingdom. 
In North America, three variants of certain four-cylinder diesel engines are affected. Due to considerably stricter NO
x 
limits in the 
USA, it is a greater technical challenge to refit the vehicles so that all applicable emissions limits can be met. 
Volkswagen is currently in intensive discussions with the 
EPA and CARB concerning remedial measures. 
On November 2, 2015, the 
EPA issued another “Notice of Violation” alleging that irregularities had also been dis-
covered in the software installed in vehicles with type V6 3.0 l diesel engines. 
CARB also issued a letter announcing its own 
enforcement investigation in this context. 
After discussions with the 
EPA and CARB, Audi publicly announced on November 23, 2015 that it would revise the 
software parameters and resubmit them for approval in the 
USA. The technical solutions will be implemented as soon as 
they have been approved by the authorities. Around 113 thousand vehicles from the 2009 to 2016 model years of the Audi, 
Volkswagen Passenger Cars and Porsche brands are affected in the 
USA and Canada.  
The technical solutions worldwide currently cover software and, in some cases, hardware modifications and 
repurchases, depending on the series, model year and country concerned. Consequently, the Volkswagen Group has 
 
  ",,,,,,,,,,
235,"  
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
204 recognized expenses directly related to the diesel issue in the total amount of €16.2 billion in operating result. This 
primarily entailed recognizing provisions for field activities (service measures and recalls) and for repurchases in the 
amount of €7.8 billion, as well as €7.0 billion for legal risks. In addition, impairment losses of €0.8 billion were recognized 
for assets and expenses of €0.6 billion were recognized for the sales programs directly related to the diesel issue. The 
carrying amount of the provisions reflects the current status of discussions with the relevant authorities and is measured as 
far as possible on the basis of past experience and on estimates, depending on the technical complexity of the remedial 
actions concerned. €0.9 billion of the expenses was recognized in distribution expenses and €7.0 billion in other operating 
expenses. The other expenses are attributable to cost of sales. Please refer to the “Litigation” section for a discussion of the 
legal risks associated with the diesel issue. The ongoing investigations mean that assessment of the circumstances is 
subject to estimation risk. In particular, the estimates may experience considerable change as the technical measures in 
the 
USA and Canada take shape and the legal risks crystallize. 
In addition, internal risk regulations required hedging transactions to be discontinued in this context. In accordance 
with 
IAS 39.101(b), the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognized from the period when 
the hedge was effective remains separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. 
Based on current information, fiscal year 2014 is not affected by the effects of the diesel issue. Even after the 
International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) study was published in May 2014, the discrepancies were initially 
regarded – on the basis of the facts currently known regarding the members of the Board of Management responsible at 
that time – as a technical problem that did not basically differ from other everyday technical problems at an automotive 
company. In the exhaust measurements carried out in-house at Volkswagen in the subsequent months, the test set-ups on 
which the ICCT study was based were repeated and the unusually high NO
x emissions confirmed. CARB was informed of 
this result, and at the same time the offer was made to recalibrate the type EA 189 diesel engines as part of a service 
measure that was already planned in the USA. This measure was evaluated and adopted by the Ausschuss für Produkt-
sicherheit (APS – product safety committee), which includes, among others, employees from the technical development, 
quality assurance, sales, production, logistics, procurement and legal departments, as part of the existing processes within 
the Volkswagen Group. The APS thus plays a central role in the internal control system at Volkswagen AG. There are 
currently no reliable findings to confirm that an unlawful software modification was reported by the APS as the cause of the 
discrepancies to the persons responsible for preparing the 2014 annual and consolidated financial statements. Instead, at 
the time that the annual and consolidated financial statements were being prepared, this group of people remained under 
the impression that the discrepancies could be eliminated with comparatively little effort as a part of a field measure. Based 
on what is currently known, the actual background of the discrepancies only became clear gradually to the members of the 
Board of Management dealing with the matter. It was only reliably recognized in the summer of 2015 that the cause of the 
discrepancies was a software modification, to be qualified as a so-called ""defeat device"" as defined by US environmental 
law. This culminated in the disclosure of the ""defeat device"" to the EPA/CARB on September 3, 2015. According to the 
assessment at that time of the members of the Board of Management dealing with the matter, the scope of the costs 
expected as a result by the Volkswagen Group (recall costs, retrofitting costs and financial penalties), was basically not 
dissimilar to that of previous cases in which other vehicle manufacturers were involved, and therefore appeared to be 
controllable overall with a view to the business activities of the Volkswagen Group. This appraisal by Volkswagen AG was 
based on the assessment of a law firm brought in in the USA for approval issues, according to which similar cases in the 
past were resolved amicably with the US authorities. Publication of a ""Notice of Violation"" by the EPA on September 18, 
2015, which came as a surprise to the company, on the facts and possible financial consequences, then presented the 
situation in a completely different light.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
205  Basis of consolidation 
In addition to Volkswagen AG, the consolidated financial statements comprise all significant German and non-German 
subsidiaries, including structured entities that are controlled directly or indirectly by Volkswagen AG. This is the case if 
Volkswagen AG obtains power over the potential subsidiaries directly or indirectly from voting rights or similar rights, is 
exposed, or has rights to, positive or negative variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiaries, and is able to 
influence those returns. In the case of the structured entities consolidated in the Volkswagen Group, Volkswagen is able to 
direct the material relevant activities remaining after the change in the structure even if it is not invested in the structured 
entity concerned and is thus able to influence the variable returns from its involvement. The structured entities are used 
primarily to enter into asset-backed securities transactions to refinance the financial services business and to invest sur-
plus liquidity in special securities funds. Consolidation of subsidiaries begins at the first date on which control exists, and 
ends when such control no longer exists. 
Subsidiaries whose business is dormant or of low volume and that are insignificant, both individually and in the 
aggregate, for the fair presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations as well as the cash flows of 
the Volkswagen Group are not consolidated. They were carried in the consolidated financial statements at cost net of any 
impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses required to be recognized. 
Significant companies where Volkswagen AG is able, directly or indirectly, to significantly influence financial and 
operating policy decisions (associates), or that are directly or indirectly jointly controlled (joint ventures), are accounted for 
using the equity method. Joint ventures also include companies in which the Volkswagen Group holds the majority of 
voting rights, but whose articles of association or partnership agreements stipulate that important decisions may only be 
resolved unanimously. Insignificant associates and joint ventures are carried at cost net of any impairment losses and 
reversals of impairment losses required to be recognized.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
207  CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  On March 14, 2014, Volkswagen AG published an offer to the shareholders of Scania Aktiebolag, Södertälje, (“Scania”) to 
acquire all Scania A and Scania B shares. Each Scania A share conveys one vote at the general meeting, while each Scania B 
share conveys one-tenth of a vote. There are no other legal differences between Scania A and B shares. Volkswagen AG 
offered 
SEK 200 for each Scania share, regardless of share class. One of the conditions of the offer was that it resulted in 
the Volkswagen Group holding more than 90 percent of the total number of Scania shares. When the offer to the Scania 
shareholders was published, the present value of the put options granted amounting to approximately €6.7 billion was 
recognized as a current liability without affecting profit or loss. The Group’s retained earnings declined by the same 
amount. 
Starting on May 7, 2014, Volkswagen acquired a total of 2.4 million Scania shares outside the offer (10,941 A shares 
and 2,400,679 B shares). This corresponds to 0.30% of Scania shares and 0.06% of the voting rights. 
The condition for the Volkswagen Group to hold more than 90% of the total number of Scania shares was satisfied on 
May 13, 2014, and Volkswagen initiated a squeeze-out for the Scania shares that were not tendered in the course of the offer. 
At the end of the second extended acceptance period on June 5, 2014, the number of shares tendered under the terms 
of the offer, together with the shares already held by Volkswagen either directly or indirectly, amounted to a total of 796.6 
million Scania shares, comprising 398.7 million A shares and 397.8 million B shares. This corresponds to 99.57% of Scania 
shares and 99.66% of the voting rights. 
On completion of the offer, the equity interest in Scania previously attributable to noncontrolling interest share-
holders amounting to €2,123 million was required to be reclassified from noncontrolling interests to the reserves attri-
butable to the shareholders of Volkswagen AG. The difference of €4,527 million reduced the retained earnings attributable 
to Volkswagen AG shareholders by the same amount.  
The changes in the carrying amount of the liability of €96 million that was recognized when the offer was published, 
which were due primarily to exchange rate movements, were recognized in the financial result in profit or loss. 
In the previous year, the shares already tendered resulted in a cash outflow of €6,535 million, net of exchange rate 
effects. This amount is reported within financing activities in the cash flow statement for fiscal year 2014 as an outflow 
from capital transactions with noncontrolling interests. At the prior-year reporting date, a liability of €78 million from put 
options and compensation rights granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders was recognized for the remaining 
shares that are subject to the squeeze-out. The court of arbitration with jurisdiction has now decided that the remaining 
shares will be transferred to Volkswagen. On January 14, 2015, it was confirmed to us that the period for appealing against 
this decision had ended. As of that date, Volkswagen controls 100% of the shares in Scania. Volkswagen AG paid out the non-
controlling interest shareholders on April 21, 2015. A judicial decision has yet to be taken on the appropriate settlement. 
The other changes in the basis of consolidation are shown in the following table:

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
208 The initial inclusion of these subsidiaries, either individually or collectively, did not have a significant effect on the pre-
sentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations. The unconsolidated structured entities are 
immaterial from a Group perspective. In particular, they do not give rise to any significant risks to the Group. 
 
INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES 
From a Group perspective, the associates Sinotruk (Hong Kong) Ltd., Hongkong (Sinotruk), Bertrandt AG, Ehningen 
(Bertrandt) and There Holding B.V., Rijswijk (There Holding) were material at the reporting date. 
 
Sinotruk 
Sinotruk is one of the largest truck manufacturers in the Chinese market. There is an agreement in place between Group 
companies and Sinotruk regarding a long-term strategic partnership, under which the Group participates in the local 
market. In addition to the partnership with Sinotruk in the volume segment, exports of 
MAN vehicles to China are also 
helping to expand access to the small, but fast-growing premium truck market. Sinotruk’s principal place of business is in 
Hongkong, China. 
As of December 31, 2015, the quoted market price of the shares in Sinotruk amounted to €251 million (previous year: 
€317 million). 
 
Bertrandt  
On July 2, 2014, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, Stuttgart, increased its interest in Bertrandt by just under 4%. Following this 
acquisition, Volkswagen indirectly holds just under 29% of the voting shares of Bertrandt. There has been no change in the 
intention not to exercise any influence on Bertrandt’s supervisory board or management board. Bertrandt has been 
included in the Volkswagen Group’s consolidated financial statements as an equity-accounted associate from the date on 
which the additional shares were acquired. In the previous year, the amounts resulting from the fair value measurement of 
the shares amounting to €148 million that had previously been recognized outside profit or loss in the other reserves in 
this connection were recognized in profit or loss in the other financial result. 
Bertrandt is an engineering partner to companies in the automotive and aviation industry. Its portfolio of services 
ranges from developing individual components through complex modules to end-to-end solutions. Bertrandt’s principal 
place of business is in Ehningen. 
As of December 31, 2015, the quoted market price of the shares in Bertrandt amounted to €327 million (previous year: 
€338 million). 
 
There Holding 
Audi, the BMW Group and Daimler AG each acquired a 33.3% interest in There Holding, which was formed in 2015. 
Effective December 4, 2015, There Holding acquired all shares in the 
HERE Group through a wholly owned subsidiary, 
There Acquisition B.V., Rijswijk (the Netherlands), for a purchase price of €2,602 million. 
HERE develops and sells high-
resolution maps with real-time location information. The purchase price was financed largely by way of capital contri-
butions at There Holding. Audi’s share of it amounts to €668 million. The remainder of the purchase price was financed 
through bank loans at There Acquisition B.V. There Acquisition B.V. was renamed 
HERE International B.V. on January 29, 
2016. 
There Holding is an associate that is accounted for using the equity method. As the acquisition took place near the end 
of the reporting period, it was not possible to fully identify all hidden reserves and liabilities. This is expected to be done in 
the first quarter of 2016. In light of this, and also for reasons of materiality, There Holding was not included at the reporting 
date on the basis of the Group’s share of profit or loss.

Global Mobility Holding 
Through its 50% interest in the joint venture Global Mobility Holding B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands ( GMH), the Volks-
wagen Group holds a 50% indirect stake in the joint venture’s subsidiary, LeasePlan Corporation N.V., Amsterdam, the 
Netherlands (LeasePlan). 
GMH’s business activity consists of holding the interest in LeasePlan. LeasePlan is a Dutch finan-
cial services group whose core business is leasing and fleet management
. GMH’s principal place of business is in 
Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 
In 2010, Volkswagen agreed with Fleet Investments B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands, an investment company belong-
ing to the von Metzler family, that Fleet Investments would become the new co-investor in Global Mobility Holding. The 
previous co-investors were instructed by Volkswagen AG to transfer their shares to Fleet Investments B.V. on February 1, 
2010 for the purchase price of €1.4 billion. Volkswagen AG has granted the new co-investor a put option on its shares. If 
this option is exercised, Volkswagen must pay the original purchase price, less purchase price reductions, plus accumu-
lated pro rata preferred dividends. Additionally, Volkswagen AG has a preemptive right of purchase at any applicable 
higher fair value. The put option is accounted for at fair value. 
In addition, Volkswagen has pledged claims under certificates of deposit with Bankhaus Metzler in the amount of €1.3 
billion to secure a loan granted to Fleet Investments B.V. by Bankhaus Metzler. This pledge does not increase the Volks-
wagen Group’s risk arising from the above-mentioned short position. In fiscal year 2015, the put option and the certif-
icates of deposit were prolonged until a maximum of September 30, 2018, subject to several conditions. 
On July 23, 2015, 
GMH sold its 100% interest in LeasePlan to a consortium of international investors. The legal 
transfer of the shares is subject to the condition precedent that the necessary official approvals are issued during the 
further course of the sale. The transaction could not be completed in the past fiscal year because official approvals are still 
outstanding. With respect to the final official approvals issued in January 2016, please refer to the disclosures on “Events 
after the balance sheet date”. 
Volkswagen AG did not grant additional credit lines either to the consortium of investors or to LeasePlan in connection 
with the intended sale of the indirect interest in LeasePlan. On completion of the transaction, the existing credit line of 
€1.3 billion provided by the Volkswagen Group will be cancelled. ",,,,,,,,,,

214 OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS On August 29, 2015, an arbitration ruling was delivered to the parties in the proceedings between Suzuki Motor Corpo-
ration and Volkswagen AG. It found that Volkswagen had acted in accordance with the agreement. The arbitration court 
also confirmed that Suzuki was in breach of contract and, on the merits of this case, acknowledged that Volkswagen had a 
claim to damages. In addition, the arbitration court established that the parties had the right to give regular notice to 
terminate the cooperation agreement. It said that Suzuki had exercised this right, ending the partnership. According to the 
court, the agreements had to be interpreted in such a way that Volkswagen had to sell its equity investment in Suzuki on 
termination of the partnership. Volkswagen consequently sold its 19.9% equity investment to Suzuki on September 17, 
2015 at the quoted market price of €3.1 billion. The sale of the shares generated income in the amount of €1.5 billion, 
which was recognized in the other financial result. 
In February 2016, Volkswagen and Suzuki agreed a settlement in respect of the claims for damages brought by Volks-
wagen. 
Consolidation methods 
The assets and liabilities of the German and foreign companies included in the consolidated financial statements are 
recognized in accordance with the uniform accounting policies used within the Volkswagen Group. In the case of com-
panies accounted for using the equity method, the same accounting policies are applied to determine the proportionate 
equity, based on the most recent audited annual financial statements of each company. 
In the case of subsidiaries consolidated for the first time, assets and liabilities are measured at their fair value at the 
date of acquisition. Their carrying amounts are adjusted in subsequent years. Goodwill arises when the purchase price of 
the investment exceeds the fair value of identifiable net assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment once a year to determine 
whether its carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount of goodwill is higher than the recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss must be recognized. If this is not the case, there is no change in the carrying amount of goodwill com-
pared with the previous year. If the purchase price of the investment is less than the identifiable net assets, the difference is 
recognized in the income statement in the year of acquisition. Goodwill is accounted for at the subsidiaries in the 
functional currency of those subsidiaries. Any difference that arises from the acquisition of additional shares of an already 
consolidated subsidiary is taken directly to equity. Unless otherwise stated, the proportionate equity directly attributable to 
noncontrolling interests is determined at the acquisition date as the share of the fair value of the assets (excluding 
goodwill) and liabilities attributable to them. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration do not generally result in the adjustment of the 
acquisition-date measurement. Acquisition-related costs that are not equity transaction costs are not added to the purchase 
price, but instead recognized as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. 
The consolidation process involves adjusting the items in the separate financial statements of the parent and its 
subsidiaries and presenting them as if they were those of a single economic entity. Intragroup assets, liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows are eliminated in full. Intercompany profits or losses are eliminated in Group inventories 
and noncurrent assets. Deferred taxes are recognized for consolidation adjustments, and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are offset where taxes are levied by the same tax authority and relate to the same tax period.

215  Currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated in the single-entity financial statements of  Volkswagen AG and its 
consolidated subsidiaries at the rates prevailing at the transaction date. Foreign currency monetary items are recorded in 
the balance sheet using the middle rate at the closing date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the income 
statement. This does not apply to foreign exchange differences from loans receivable that represent part of a net invest-
ment in a foreign operation. The financial statements of foreign companies are translated into euros using the functional 
currency concept, under which asset and liability items are translated at the closing rate. With the exception of income and 
expenses recognized directly in equity, equity is translated at historical rates. The resulting foreign exchange differences 
are recognized in other comprehensive income until disposal of the subsidiary concerned, and are presented as a separate 
item in equity. 
Income statement items are translated into euros at weighted average rates.  
The rates applied are presented in the following table:

216 Accounting policies 
MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES 
With certain exceptions such as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets 
and provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits, items in the Volkswagen Group are accounted for under 
the historical cost convention. The methods used to measure the individual items are explained in more detail below. 
 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost and amortized over their useful life using the straight-line method. This 
relates in particular to software, which is amortized over three years. 
In accordance with 
IAS 38, research costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. 
Development costs for future series products and other internally generated intangible assets are capitalized at cost, 
provided manufacture of the products is likely to bring the Volkswagen Group an economic benefit. If the criteria for 
recognition as assets are not met, the expenses are recognized in the income statement in the year in which they are 
incurred. 
Capitalized development costs include all direct and indirect costs that are directly attributable to the development 
process. The costs are amortized using the straight-line method from the start of production over the expected life cycle of 
the models or powertrains developed – generally between two and ten years. 
Amortization recognized during the year is allocated to the relevant functions in the income statement. 
Brand names from business combinations usually have an indefinite useful life and are therefore not amortized. An 
indefinite useful life is usually the result of a brand’s further use and maintenance. 
Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested 
for impairment at least once a year. Assets in use and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impair-
ment only if there are specific indications that they may be impaired. The Volkswagen Group generally applies the higher of 
value in use and fair value less costs to sell of the relevant cash-generating unit (brands or products) to determine the 
recoverable amount of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Measurement of value in use is based on manage-
ment’s current planning. This planning is based on expectations regarding future global economic trends and on 
assumptions derived from those trends about the markets for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, market shares and 
the profitability of the products. The planning for the Financial Services segment is likewise prepared on the basis of these 
expectations, and also reflects the relevant market penetration rates and regulatory requirements. The planning for the 
Power Engineering segment reflects expectations about trends in the various individual markets. The planning includes 
reasonable assumptions about macroeconomic trends (exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price trends) and 
historical developments. The planning period generally covers five years. For information on the assumptions applied to 
the detailed planning period, please refer to the Report on Expected Developments, which is part of the Management 
Report. For subsequent years, plausible assumptions are made regarding future trends. The planning assumptions are 
adapted to reflect the current state of knowledge.  
Estimation of cash flows is generally based on the expected growth trends for the markets concerned. The estimates for 
the cash flows following the end of the planning period are generally based on a growth rate of up to 1% p.a. (previous year: 
up to 1% p.a.) in the Passenger Cars and Financial Services segments, and on a growth rate of up to 1% p.a. (previous year: 
up to 1% p.a.) in the Power Engineering and Commercial Vehicles segments.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
217  Value in use is determined for the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-
lived intangible assets – mainly capitalized development costs – using the following pretax weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC)  rates, which are adjusted if necessary for country-specific discount factors: 
 

    
    
WACC 
 20152014

   

Passenger Cars segment 
 6.5%6.1%

Commercial Vehicles segment 
 7.7%9.8%

Power Engineering segment 
 9.2%12.6%

 
A minimum cost of equity of 8.5% (previous year: 8.6%) is used for the Financial Services segment in line with the sector-
specific need to reflect third-party borrowings. If necessary, this rate is additionally adjusted for country-specific discount 
factors.  
The 
WACC rates are calculated based on the risk-free rate of interest, a market risk premium and the cost of debt. 
Addtionally, specific peer group information on beta factors and leverage are taken into account. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less depreciation and – where necessary – write-downs for impairment. 
Investment grants are generally deducted from cost. Cost is determined on the basis of the direct and indirect costs that are 
directly attributable. Special tools are reported under other equipment, operating and office equipment. Property, plant 
and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. The useful lives of items of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted if required. 
Depreciation is based mainly on the following useful lives: 


   
   
  

 Useful life


   
Buildings 
 20 to 50 years

Site improvements 
 10 to 20 years

Technical equipment and machinery 
 6 to 12 years

Other equipment, operating and office equipment, including special tools 
 3 to 15 years

 

 
Impairment losses on property, plant and equipment are recognized in accordance with 
IAS 36 where the recoverable 
amount of the asset concerned has fallen below the carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and 
fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is determined using the principles described for intangible assets. The discount 
rates for product-specific tools and investments are the same as the discount rates for capitalized development costs given 
above for each segment. If the reasons for impairments recognized in previous years no longer apply, the impairment 
losses are reversed up to a maximum of the amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had been 
recognized. 
In accordance with the principle of substance over form, assets that have been formally transferred to third parties 
under a sale and leaseback transaction including a repurchase option also continue to be accounted for as separate assets. 
  ",,,,,,,,,,
249,"  
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
218 Where leased items of property, plant and equipment are used, the criteria for classification as a finance lease as set out in 
IAS 17 are met if all material risks and rewards incidental to ownership have been transferred to the Group company 
concerned. In such cases, the assets concerned are recognized at fair value or at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments (if lower) and depreciated using the straight-line method over the asset’s useful life, or over the term of the lease 
if this is shorter. The payment obligations arising from the future lease payments are discounted and recorded as a liability 
in the balance sheet. 
Where Group companies are the lessees of assets under operating leases, i.e. if not all material risks and rewards are 
transferred, lease and rental payments are recorded directly as expenses in profit or loss. 
LEASE ASSETS 
Vehicles leased out under operating leases are recognized at cost and depreciated to their estimated residual value using 
the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Impairment losses identified as a result of an impairment test in 
accordance with 
IAS 36 are recognized and the depreciation rate is adjusted. The forecast residual values are adjusted to 
include constantly updated internal and external information on residual values, depending on specific local factors and 
the experiences gained in the marketing of used cars. This requires management to make assumptions in particular about 
vehicle supply and demand in the future, as well as about vehicle price trends. Such assumptions are based either on 
qualified estimates or on data published by external experts. Qualified estimates are based on external data – if available –
that reflects additional information that is available internally, such as historical experience and current sales data.  
 
INVESTMENT PROPERTY 
Real estate and buildings held in order to obtain rental income (investment property) are carried at amortized cost; the 
useful lives applied to depreciation generally correspond to those of the property, plant and equipment used by the Com-
pany itself. The fair value of investment property must be disclosed in the notes if it is carried at amortized cost. Fair value is 
generally estimated using an investment method based on internal calculations. This involves determining the income 
value for a specific building on the basis of gross income, taking into account additional factors such as land value, 
remaining useful life and a multiplier specific to property. 
 
CAPITALIZATION OF BORROWING COSTS 
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of qualifying assets on or after January 1, 2009 are 
capitalized as part of the cost of these assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes at least a year to get ready 
for its intended use or sale.  
 
EQUITY-ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 
The cost of equity-accounted investments is adjusted to reflect the share of increases or reductions in equity at the asso-
ciates and joint ventures after the acquisition that is attributable to the Volkswagen Group, as well as any effects from 
purchase price allocation. Additionally, the investment is tested for impairment if there are indications of impairment and 
written down to the lower recoverable amount if necessary. Recoverable amount is determined using the principles 
described for indefinite-lived intangible assets. If the reason for impairment ceases to apply at a later date, the impairment 
loss is reversed to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized. 
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one company and a financial liability or an equity 
instrument of another. Regular way purchases or sales of financial instruments are accounted for at the settlement date  
– that is, at the date on which the asset is delivered. 
 
  ",,,,,,,,,,
250,"   
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
219  IAS 39 classifies financial assets into the following categories: 
> financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; 
> held-to-maturity financial assets; 
> loans and receivables; and 
> and available-for-sale financial assets. 
 
Financial liabilities are classified into the following categories: 
> financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; and 
> financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. 
 
We recognize financial instruments at amortized cost or at fair value. 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or liability is the amount: 
> at which a financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition; 
> minus any principal repayments; 
> minus any write-down for impairment or uncollectibility; 
> plus or minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between the original amount and the amount repayable at 
maturity (premium, discount), amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the financial asset or 
liability. 
In the case of current receivables and liabilities, amortized cost generally corresponds to the principal or repayment 
amount. 
Fair value generally corresponds to the market or quoted market price. If no active market exists, fair value is 
determined using other observable inputs as far as possible. If no observable inputs are available, fair value is determined 
using valuation techniques, such as by discounting the future cash flows at the market interest rate, or by using recognized 
option pricing models, and, as far as possible, verified by confirmations from the banks that handle the transactions. 
The fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities is not used in the Volkswagen Group. 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally presented at their gross amounts and only offset if the Volks-
wagen Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to 
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that are not consolidated for reasons of materiality do not fall within the 
scope of 
IAS 39. As of fiscal year 2015, the related amounts are therefore excluded from the disclosures in accordance with 
IFRS 7. Other equity investments that are required by  IAS 39.46(c) to be measured at cost, net of any impairment losses to 
be recognized, are presented as “measured at fair value”. In addition, the tables under 
IFRS 7 were extended to incorpo-
rate a separate class for derivative financial instruments included in hedging relationships. The relevant tables and prior-
year amounts were adjusted. 
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 
Loans, receivables and liabilities, as well as held-to-maturity financial assets, are measured at amortized cost, unless 
hedged. Specifically, these relate to: 
> receivables from financing business; 
> trade receivables and payables; 
> other receivables and financial assets and liabilities; 
> financial liabilities; and 
> cash, cash equivalents and time deposits.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
220 AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Available-for-sale financial assets are either allocated specifically to this category or are financial assets that cannot be 
assigned to any other category. 
Available-for-sale financial assets (debt instruments) are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized 
directly in equity, net of deferred taxes. Prolonged changes in the fair value of debt instruments (impairment losses, 
foreign exchange gains and losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method) are recognized in profit or loss.  
Other equity investments (shares representing an ownership interest of less than 20% as a rule) are also classified as 
available-for-sale financial assets. They are recognized at cost in the consolidated financial statements if there is no active 
market for those shares and fair values cannot be reliably ascertained without undue cost or effort. The lower present value 
of the estimated future cash flows is recognized if there are indications of impairment. There is currently no intention to 
sell these financial assets. Foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to equity instruments are recognized in other 
comprehensive income. 
DERIVATIVES AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
Volkswagen Group companies use derivatives to hedge balance sheet items and future cash flows (hedged items). Appro-
priate derivatives such as swaps, forward transactions and options are used as hedging instruments. The criteria for the 
application of hedge accounting are that the hedging relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is 
clearly documented and that the hedge is highly effective. 
The accounting treatment of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship. In the case of hedges against the risk of change in the carrying amount of balance sheet items (fair value 
hedges), both the hedging instrument and the hedged risk portion of the hedged item are measured at fair value. Several 
risk portions of hedged items are grouped into a portfolio if appropriate. In the case of a fair value portfolio hedge, the 
changes in fair value are accounted for in the same way as for a fair value hedge of an individual underlying. Gains or losses 
from the remeasurement of hedging instruments and hedged items are recognized in profit or loss. In the case of hedges 
of future cash flows (cash flow hedges), the hedging instruments are also measured at fair value. Gains or losses from 
remeasurement of the effective portion of the derivative are initially recognized in the reserve for cash flow hedges directly 
in equity, and are only recognized in the income statement when the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss; the 
ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  
Derivatives used by the Volkswagen Group for financial management purposes to hedge against interest rate, foreign 
currency, commodity, or price risks, but that do not meet the strict hedge accounting criteria of 
IAS 39, are classified as 
financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (also referred to below as “derivatives not included in 
hedging relationships”). This also applies to options on shares. External hedges of intragroup hedged items that are sub-
sequently eliminated in the consolidated financial statements are also assigned to this category as a general rule. Assets 
and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss consist of derivatives or components of derivatives that are not 
included in hedge accounting. These relate primarily to the interest component of currency forwards used to hedge sales 
revenue, commodity futures and currency forwards relating to commodity futures. Gains and losses from the remeasure-
ment and settlement of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss are reported in the financial result. 
RECEIVABLES FROM FINANCE LEASES 
Where a Group company is the lessor – generally of vehicles – a receivable in the amount of the net investment in the lease 
is recognized in the case of finance leases, in other words where substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred to 
the lessee. 
 
OTHER RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL ASSETS 
Other receivables and financial assets (except for derivatives) are recognized at amortized cost.

221  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  Default risk on loans and receivables in the financial services business is accounted for by recognizing specific valuation 
allowances and portfolio-based valuation allowances.  
More specifically, in the case of significant individual receivables (e.g. dealer finance receivables and fleet customer 
business receivables) specific valuation allowances are recognized in accordance with Group-wide standards in the amount 
of the incurred loss. A potential impairment is assumed in the case of a number of situations such as delayed payment over 
a certain period, the institution of enforcement measures, the threat of insolvency or overindebtedness, application for or 
the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, or the failure of reorganization measures.  
Portfolio-based valuation allowances are recognized by grouping together insignificant receivables and significant 
individual receivables for which there is no indication of impairment into homogeneous portfolios on the basis of com-
parable credit risk features and allocating them by risk class. As long as no definite information is available as to which 
receivables are in default, average historical default probabilities for the portfolio concerned are used to calculate the 
amount of the valuation allowances.  
As a matter of principle, specific valuation allowances are recognized on receivables outside the Financial Services 
segment.  
Valuation allowances on receivables are regularly recognized in separate allowance accounts. 
An impairment loss is recognized on available-for-sale financial assets if there is objective evidence of permanent 
impairment. In the case of equity instruments, evidence of impairment is taken to exist, among other things, if the fair value 
decreases below cost significantly (by more than 20%) or the decrease is prolonged (by more than 10% of the average 
market prices over one year). If impairment is identified, the cumulative loss is recognized in the reserve and charged to 
profit and loss. In the case of equity instruments, reversals of impairment losses are taken directly to equity. Impairment 
losses are recognized on debt instruments if a decrease in the future cash flows of the financial asset is expected. An 
increase in the risk-free interest rate or an increase in credit risk premiums is not in itself evidence of impairment. 
DEFERRED TAXES 
Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for tax-deductible temporary differences between the tax base of assets and 
their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet, as well as on tax loss carryforwards and tax credits provided it is 
probable that they can be used in future periods. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary 
differences between the tax base of liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized in the amount of the expected tax liability or tax benefit, as appro-
priate, in subsequent fiscal years, based on the expected enacted tax rate at the time of realization. The tax consequences of 
dividend payments are generally not taken into account until the resolution on appropriation of earnings available for 
distribution has been adopted. 
Deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be realized within a clearly predictable period are reduced by valuation 
allowances. 
Deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards are usually measured on the basis of future taxable income over a planning 
period of five fiscal years. 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and 
relate to the same tax period. 
INVENTORIES 
Raw materials, consumables and supplies, merchandise, work in progress and self-produced finished goods reported in 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the basis of the direct and indirect 
costs that are directly attributable. Borrowing costs are not capitalized. The measurement of same or similar inventories is 
generally based on the weighted average cost method.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
222 NONCURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Under IFRS 5, noncurrent assets or groups of assets and liabilities (disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their 
carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Such assets 
are carried at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, and are presented separately in current 
assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. 
Discontinued operations are components of an entity that have either been disposed of or are classified as held for 
sale. The assets and liabilities of operations that are held for sale represent disposal groups that must be measured and 
reported using the same principles as noncurrent assets held for sale. The income and expenses from discontinued 
operations are presented in the income statement as “profit or loss from discontinued operations” below the profit or loss 
from continuing operations. Corresponding disposal gains or losses are contained in the profit or loss from discontinued 
operations. The prior-year figures in the income statement are adjusted accordingly. 
PENSION PROVISIONS 
The actuarial valuation of pension provisions is based on the projected unit credit method stipulated by  IAS 19 for defined 
benefit plans. The valuation is not only based on pension payments and vested entitlements known at the balance sheet 
date, but also reflects future salary and pension trends, as well as experience-based staff turnover rates. Remeasurements 
are recognized in retained earnings in other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes. 
 
PROVISIONS FOR TAXES 
Tax provisions contain obligations resulting from current taxes. Deferred taxes are presented in separate items of the 
balance sheet and income statement. Provisions are recognized for potential tax risks on the basis of the best estimate of 
the liability.  
 
OTHER PROVISIONS 
In accordance with  IAS 37, provisions are recognized where a present obligation exists to third parties as a result of a past 
event, where a future outflow of resources is probable and where a reliable estimate of that outflow can be made. 
Provisions not resulting in an outflow of resources in the year immediately following are recognized at their settlement 
value discounted to the balance sheet date. Discounting is based on market interest rates. An average discount rate of 0.45% 
(previous year: 0.36%) was used in the eurozone. The settlement value also reflects cost increases expected at the balance 
sheet date. 
Provisions are not offset against claims for reimbursement. 
We recognize insurance contracts that form part of the insurance business in accordance with 
IFRS 4. Reinsurance 
acceptances are accounted for without any time delay in the year in which they arise. Provisions are generally recognized 
based on the cedants’ contractual duties. Estimation techniques based on assumptions about future changes in claims are 
used to calculate the claims provision. Other technical provisions relate to the provision for cancellations. 
The share of the provisions attributable to reinsurers is calculated in accordance with the contractual agreements with 
the retrocessionaries and reported under other assets. 
LIABILITIES 
Noncurrent liabilities are recorded at amortized cost in the balance sheet. Differences between historical cost and the 
repayment amount are amortized using the effective interest method. 
Liabilities to members of partnerships from puttable shares are recognized in the income statement at the present 
value of the redemption amount at the balance sheet date. 
Liabilities under finance leases are carried at the present value of the lease payments. 
Current liabilities are recognized at their repayment or settlement value.

223  REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION Sales revenue, interest and commission income from financial services and other operating income are recognized only 
when the relevant service has been rendered or the goods have been delivered, that is, when the risk has passed to the 
customer, the amount of sales revenue can be reliably determined and settlement of the amount can be assumed. Revenue 
is reported net of sales allowances (discounts, rebates, or customer bonuses). Sales revenue from financing and lease 
agreements is recognized using the effective interest method. If non-interest-bearing or low-interest vehicle financing 
arrangements are agreed, sales revenue is reduced by the interest benefits granted. Revenue from operating leases is 
recognized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Sales revenue from extended warranties or main-
tenance agreements is recognized when deliveries take place or services are rendered. In the case of prepayments, 
deferred income is recognized proportionately by reference to the costs expected to be incurred, based on experience. 
Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis if there is insufficient experience. If the expected costs exceed the accrued 
sales revenue, a loss is recognized from these agreements. 
If a contract comprises several separately identifiable components (multiple-element arrangements), these compo-
nents are recognized separately in accordance with the principles outlined above.  
Income from assets for which a Group company has a buy back obligation is recognized only when the assets have 
definitively left the Group. If a fixed repurchase price was agreed when the contract was entered into, the difference 
between the selling price and the present value of the repurchase price is recognized as income ratably over the term of the 
contract. Prior to that time, the assets are carried as inventories in the case of short contract terms and as lease assets in the 
case of long contract terms.  
Cost of sales includes the costs incurred to generate the sales revenue and the cost of goods purchased for resale. This 
item also includes the costs of additions to warranty provisions. Research and development costs not eligible for capital-
ization in the period and amortization of development costs are likewise carried under cost of sales. Reflecting the 
presentation of interest and commission income in sales revenue, the interest and commission expenses attributable to 
the financial services business are presented in cost of sales. 
Construction contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion (PoC) method, under which revenue and 
cost of sales are recognized by reference to the stage of completion at the end of the reporting period, based on the contract 
revenue agreed with the customer and the expected contract costs. As a rule, the stage of completion is determined as the 
proportion that contract costs incurred by the end of the reporting period bear to the estimated total contract costs (cost-to-
cost method). In certain cases, in particular those involving innovative, complex contracts, the stage of completion is 
measured using contractually agreed milestones (milestone method). If the outcome of a construction contract cannot yet 
be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognized only in the amount of the contract costs incurred to date (zero profit 
method). In the balance sheet, contract components whose revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion 
method are reported as trade receivables, net of prepayments received. Expected losses from construction contracts are 
recognized immediately in full as expenses by recognizing impairment losses on recognized contract assets, and 
additionally by recognizing provisions for amounts in excess of the impairment losses. 
Dividend income is recognized on the date when the dividend is legally approved.  
GOVERNMENT GRANTS 
Government grants related to assets are deducted when arriving at the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in 
profit or loss over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense. If the Group becomes entitled to a 
grant subsequently, the amount of the grant attributable to prior periods is recognized in profit or loss.  
Government grants related to income, i.e. that compensate the Group for expenses incurred, are recognized in profit 
or loss for the period in those items in which the expenses to be compensated by the grants are also recognized. Grants in 
the form of nonmonetary assets (e.g. the use of land free of charge or the transfer of resources free of charge) are disclosed 
as a memo item.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
224 ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BY MANAGEMENT  Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses, as well as the related disclosure of con-
tingent assets and liabilities of the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions relate largely to the following matters:  
The impairment testing of nonfinancial assets (especially goodwill, brand names, capitalized development costs and 
special tools) and equity-accounted investments, or investments accounted at cost, and the measurement of options on 
shares in companies that are not traded in an active market require assumptions about the future cash flows during the 
planning period, and possibly beyond it, as well as about the discount rate to be applied. The estimates made in order to 
separate cash flows mainly relate to future market shares, the trend in the respective markets and the profitability of the 
Volkswagen Group’s products. In addition, the recoverability of the Group’s lease assets depends in particular on the 
residual value of the leased vehicles after expiration of the lease term, because this represents a significant portion of the 
expected cash flows. More detailed information on impairment tests and the measurement parameters used for those tests 
can be found in the explanations on the accounting policies for intangible assets.  
If there are no observable market inputs, the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business com-
bination are measured using recognized valuation techniques, such as the relief-from-royalty method or the residual 
method. 
Impairment testing of financial assets requires estimates about the extent and probability of occurrence of future events. 
As far as possible, estimates are derived from past experience taking into account current market data as well as rating 
categories and scoring information. In the case of financial services receivables, both specific and portfolio-based 
valuation allowances are recognized. The more detailed balance sheet disclosures on 
IFRS 7 (Financial Instruments) 
contain an overview of these specific and portfolio-based valuation allowances.  
Accounting for provisions is also based on estimates of the extent and probability of occurrence of future events, as well 
as estimates of the discount rate. As far as possible, these are also based on past experience or external opinions. In 
addition, the measurement of pension provisions depends on the estimated growth in plan assets. The assumptions under-
lying the measurement of pension provisions are contained in note 29. Remeasurements are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and do not affect profit or loss reported in the income statement. Any change in the estimates of the 
amount of other provisions is always recognized in profit or loss. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new 
information obtained. The use of empirical values means that additional amounts must frequently be recognized for 
provisions, or that unused provisions are reversed. Reversals of provisions are recognized as other operating income, 
whereas expenses relating to the recognition of provisions are allocated directly to the functions. Warranty claims from 
sales transactions are calculated on the basis of losses to date, estimated future losses and the policy on ex gratia arrange-
ments. This requires assumptions to be made about the nature and extent of future guarantee and ex gratia claims.

225  Assumptions were made in respect of the warranty provisions recognized in connection with the diesel issues. These 
depend on the series, model year and country concerned and relate in particular to the effort, material costs and hourly 
wage rates involved, or to vehicle values in the case of repurchases. They are based on qualified estimates, which are based 
in turn on external data, and also reflect additional information available internally, such as values derived from past 
experience. Note 30 contains an overview of other provisions. For information on litigation and legal risks associated with 
the diesel issue, see also note 37. The put options and compensation rights of free float shareholders recognized within 
liabilities depend in particular on the outcome of the 
MAN award proceedings. The liability was based on estimates of the 
length of the award proceedings and the amount of the put options and compensation rights. The length was estimated 
based on the fact that proceedings take seven years on average. The amount of the put options and compensation rights of 
MAN’s free float shareholders is derived from the cash settlement in accordance with section 305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG 
– German Stock Corporation Act). The cash settlement payable was adjusted in the fiscal year due to the ruling by the Munich 
Regional Court. 
Government grants are recognized based on an assessment as to whether there is reasonable assurance that the 
Group companies will fulfill the attached conditions and the grants will be awarded. This assessment is based on the nature 
of the legal entitlement and past experience.  
Estimates of the useful life of finite-lived assets are based on past experience and are reviewed regularly. Where 
estimates are modified the residual useful life is adjusted and an impairment loss is recognized, if necessary.  
Measuring deferred tax assets requires assumptions regarding future taxable income and the timing of the realization 
of deferred tax assets.  
The estimates and assumptions are based on underlying assumptions that reflect the current state of available knowl-
edge. Specifically, the expected future development of business was based on the circumstances known at the date of 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements and a realistic assessment of the future development of the global 
and sector-specific environment. Our estimates and assumptions remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty because 
future business developments are subject to uncertainties that in part cannot be influenced by the Group. This applies in 
particular to short- and medium-term cash flow forecasts and to the discount rates used.  
Developments in this environment that differ from the assumptions and that cannot be influenced by management 
could result in amounts that differ from the original estimates. If actual developments differ from the expected develop-
ments, the underlying assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities affected are 
adjusted. 
The moderate global economic growth slowed to 2.5% in fiscal year 2015. Our planning assumes that the global eco-
nomy will grow at a rather stronger pace in 2016 than it did in the previous year. As a result, from today’s perspective, we 
are not expecting material adjustments in the following fiscal year in the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities 
reported in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Estimates and assumptions by management were based in particular on assumptions relating to the development of 
the general economic environment, the automotive markets and the legal environment. These and further assumptions 
are explained in detail in the Report on Expected Developments, which is part of the Group Management Report.

226 Segment reporting 
Segments are identified on the basis of the Volkswagen Group’s internal management and reporting. In line with the 
Group’s multibrand strategy, each of its brands (operating segments) is managed by its own board of management. The 
Group targets and requirements laid down by the Board of Management of Volkswagen AG must be complied with. Segment 
reporting comprises four reportable segments: Passenger Cars, Commercial Vehicles, Power Engineering and Financial 
Services. The operating segments are combined into reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics (in 
particular the nature of the products or services, integration in the development, production and sales processes, and 
similar customer groups). 
The activities of the Passenger Cars segment cover the development of vehicles and engines, the production and sale of 
passenger cars, and the corresponding genuine parts business. As a rule, the Volkswagen Group’s individual passenger car 
brands are combined on a consolidated basis into a single reportable segment.  
The Commercial Vehicles segment primarily comprises the development, production and sale of light commercial 
vehicles, trucks and buses, the corresponding genuine parts business and related services. 
The activities of the Power Engineering segment consist of the development and production of large-bore diesel engines, 
turbo compressors, industrial turbines and chemical reactor systems, as well as the production of gear units, propulsion 
components and testing systems. 
The activities of the Financial Services segment comprise dealer and customer financing, leasing, banking and insur-
ance activities, fleet management and mobility services.  
Purchase price allocation for companies acquired is allocated directly to the corresponding segments.  
At Volkswagen, segment profit or loss is measured on the basis of operating profit or loss. 
In the segment reporting, the share of the profits or losses of joint ventures is contained in the share of profits and 
losses of equity-accounted investments in the corresponding segments.  
The reconciliation contains activities and other operations that by definition do not constitute segments. It also 
includes the unallocated Group financing activities. Consolidation adjustments between the segments are also contained 
in the reconciliation. 
Investments in intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investment property are reported net of invest-
ments under finance leases. 
As a matter of principle, business relationships between the companies within the segments of the Volkswagen Group 
are transacted at arm’s length prices.

For segment reporting purposes, the sales revenue of the Group is presented by segment and market.  
Other sales revenue comprises revenue from workshop services, among other things. 
Sales revenue from construction contracts amounted to €1,206 million (previous year: €1,396 million) and mainly 
related to the Power Engineering segment. 
2. Cost of sales 
Cost of sales includes interest expenses of €1,868 million (previous year: €1,955 million) attributable to the financial 
services business. This item also includes impairment losses on intangible assets (primarily development costs), property, 
plant and equipment (primarily technical equipment and machinery), and lease assets (vehicle leases) in the amount of 
€1,391 million (previous year: €377 million). The impairment losses amounting to a total of €738 million recognized 
during the reporting period on intangible assets and items of property, plant and equipment result in particular from lower 
values in use of various products in the Passenger Cars segment, from market and exchange rate risks, and in particular 
from expected declines in volumes. The impairment losses on lease assets in the amount of €652 million (including  
€33 million reported in current lease assets), which are attributable predominantly to the Financial Services segment, are 
based on constantly updated internal and external information that is factored into the forecast residual values of the 
vehicles. 
Government grants related to income amounted to €409 million in the fiscal year (previous year: €883 million) and 
were generally allocated to the functions.

The year-on-year increase in miscellaneous other operating expenses is due largely to the litigation expenses of €7.0 billion 
in connection with the diesel issue. The expenses for termination agreements result primarily from the restructuring 
expenses for the South American market and at 
MAN. In addition, the changes in the currency hedging derivatives are due 
to the exchange rate changes between the trade price and the price on realization; this applies in particular to the  
US dollar, the Chinese renminbi and sterling.

The statutory corporation tax rate in Germany for the 2015 assessment period was 15%. Including trade tax and the 
solidarity surcharge, this resulted in an aggregate tax rate of 29.8%.  
A tax rate of 29.8% (previous year: 29.8%) was used to measure deferred taxes in the German consolidated tax group. 
The local income tax rates applied for companies outside Germany vary between 0% and 45%. In the case of split tax 
rates, the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits is applied. 
The realization of tax benefits from tax loss carryforwards from previous years resulted in a reduction in current 
income taxes in 2015 of €302 million (previous year: €136 million). 
Previously unused tax loss carryforwards amounted to €18,407 million (previous year: €12,726 million). Tax loss carry-
forwards amounting to €12,663 million (previous year: €6,719 million) can be used indefinitely, while €4,120 million 
(previous year: €775 million) must be used within the next ten years. There are additional tax loss carryforwards amounting 
to €1,624 million (previous year: €5,232 million) that can be used within a period of 15 or 20 years. Tax loss carryforwards 
of €10,478 million (previous year: €9,422 million), of which €3,567 million (previous year: €3,406 million) can only be 
utilized subject to restrictions within the next 20 years, were estimated not to be usable overall.  
The benefit arising from previously unrecognized tax losses or tax credits of a prior period that is used to reduce 
current tax expense in the current fiscal year amounts to €50 million (previous year: €50 million). Deferred tax expense was 
reduced by €110 million (previous year: €49 million) because of a benefit arising from previously unrecognized tax losses 
and tax credits of a prior period. Deferred tax expense arising from the write-down of deferred tax assets amounts to  
€68 million (previous year: €253 million). Deferred tax income arising from the reversal of a write-down of a deferred tax 
asset amounts to €212 million (previous year: €117 million). 
Tax credits granted by various countries amounted to €800 million (previous year: €906 million).  
No deferred tax assets were recognized for deductible temporary differences of €1,643 million (previous year: €1,531 
million) and for tax credits of €439 million (previous year: €504 million) that would expire in the next 20 years, or for tax 
credits of €14 million (previous year: €172 million) that will not expire. 
In accordance with 
IAS 12.39, deferred tax liabilities of €193 million (previous year: €290 million) for temporary 
differences and undistributed profits of Volkswagen AG subsidiaries were not recognized because control exists. 
Due to the change in the statutory provisions in Germany, a refund claim for corporation tax was recognized as a current 
tax asset for the first time in fiscal year 2006. The present value of the refund claim was €259 million (previous year:  
€380 million) at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax income resulting from changes in tax rates amounted to €2 million at Group level (previous year:  
€7 million expense).

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
234 Deferred taxes in respect of temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards of €8,466 million (previous year: €831 million) 
were recognized without being offset by deferred tax liabilities in the same amount. The existing tax loss carryforwards of 
the companies in the German tax group that were recognized due to positive results in the past are required to be included 
in this analysis for the first time in the reporting period. The companies concerned are expecting positive tax income in the 
future, following losses in the reporting period or the previous year.  
€5,320 million (previous year: €5,180 million) of the deferred taxes recognized in the balance sheet was credited to 
equity and relates to other comprehensive income. €2 million (previous year: €2 million) of this figure is attributable to 
noncontrolling interests. There were effects from capital transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders in the 
reporting period and the prior-year period. Changes in deferred taxes classified by balance sheet item are presented in the 
statement of comprehensive income.  
In the reporting period, tax effects of €11 million (previous year: €19 million) resulting from equity transaction costs 
were recognized in equity.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
236 11. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing earnings attributable to Volkswagen AG shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary and preferred shares outstanding during the reporting period.  
In 2012 and 2013, Volkswagen AG placed two mandatory convertible notes with identical features and an aggregate 
principal amount of €3.7 billion via a subsidiary, Volkswagen International Finance N.V. Amsterdam (issuer). These notes 
matured on November 9, 2015. The note terms and conditions provided for early conversion options. This voluntary 
conversion right was exercised in the reporting period, with 27,091 new preferred shares being created from €4.7 million 
of notes based on the effective maximum conversion price at the conversion date. Under the note terms and conditions, the 
mandatory convertible notes were required to be settled by issuing new preferred shares no later than at maturity. At the 
maturity date, November 9, 2015, the remaining amount of both notes was converted by the issuer as required. A total of 
25,536,876 new preferred shares were created and the underlying principal amount of each bond was €100,000 and the 
final conversion price €144.50. 
When comparing year-on-year, it is important to bear in mind that 
IAS 33.23 sets out that all potential shares that will 
be issued upon the conversion of a mandatory convertible note must be accounted for as issued shares and included in the 
calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. In accordance with 
IAS 33.26, the number of potential preferred 
shares included in the previous year was replaced retrospectively with the shares actually issued in the reporting period 
when notes were voluntarily and mandatorily converted. As of their admission to the regulated market on June 12, 2014, 
the new preferred shares from the capital increase were included in the calculation of earnings per share for the previous 
year.  
The finance costs associated with the mandatory convertible notes were not included in the calculation of consolidated 
result because the interest component was recognized in other comprehensive income when the note was issued, and 
interest expense arose only from the amount of compound interest. Since the basic and diluted number of shares is 
identical, basic earnings per share also correspond to diluted earnings per share. See note 24 for further information 
regarding the issuance of the mandatory convertible note and the capital increase. 
Earnings per ordinary share were €–3.20 in fiscal year 2015, while earnings per preferred share were €–3.09.  
Article 27(2) No. 1 of the Articles of Association of Volkswagen AG sets out that, even in the event of a deficit, a preferred 
dividend of €0.11 per preferred share must be paid out in the subsequent fiscal years based on the cumulative arrange-
ment if no dividend is paid for the year under review; consequently, this must be factored into the calculation of earnings 
per share for the current fiscal year. The dividend proposal outlined in Note 24 that is based on Volkswagen AG’s net 
income for the year under the German Commercial Code is not relevant for the calculation of earnings per share in 
accordance with IAS 33. The payment of further dividends in accordance with Article 27(2) No. 2 and No. 3 of the Articles of 
Association of Volkswagen AG is only factored into the calculation of earnings per share when the Company generates 
earnings after tax which is attributable to Volkswagen AG shareholders.

Equity-accounted investments include joint ventures in the amount of €9,546 million (previous year: €9,159 million) and 
associates in the amount of €1,358 million (previous year: €715 million). 
€335 million of the changes in the consolidated Group between equity-accounted investments and other equity 
investments in the previous year related to the reclassification of the shares in Bertrandt because of the change in the 
method of inclusion. The acquisition of the additional shares in Bertrandt in the amount of €40 million was previously 
reported under additions of other equity investments. The additions of equity-accounted investments in the fiscal year are 
mainly attributable to There Holding. The disposals of other equity investments are mainly the result of the sale of the 
Suzuki shares. Further details can be found in the disclosures in the section entitled “Basis of consolidation”. 
Of the other changes recognized in other comprehensive income, €391 million (previous year: €379 million) is 
attributable to joint ventures and €1 million (previous year: €–
 3 million) to associates. They are mainly the result of foreign 
exchange differences in the amount of €393 million (previous year: €397 million), pension plan remeasurements in the 
amount of €–
 8 million (previous year: €–  6 million) and losses on the fair value measurement of cash flow hedges in the 
amount of €6 million (previous year: €–

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
253  24. Equity 
The subscribed capital of Volkswagen AG is composed of no-par value bearer shares with a notional value of €2.56. As well 
as ordinary shares, there are preferred shares that entitle the bearer to a €0.06 higher dividend than ordinary shares, but 
do not carry voting rights. 
The Annual General Meeting on April 19, 2012 resolved to create authorized capital of up to €110 million, expiring on 
April 18, 2017, for the issue of new ordinary bearer shares or preferred shares based. In June 2014, Volkswagen AG issued 
10,471,204 new preferred shares (with a notional value of €27 million), with the result that the remaining authorized 
capital amounts to €83 million. In 2014, Volkswagen AG recorded a cash inflow of €2,000 million from the capital increase, 
less transaction costs of €20 million. 
The Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2010 resolved to create contingent capital in the amount of up to €102 mil-
lion expiring on April 21, 2015 that could be used to issue up to €5 billion in bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds.  
To date, Volkswagen has used this contingent capital as follows: 
> In November 2012, via a subsidiary, Volkswagen International Finance N.V. Amsterdam/the Netherlands (issuer), Volks-
wagen AG placed a €2.5 billion mandatory convertible note that entitled and obliged holders to subscribe for Volkswagen 
preferred shares. The preemptive rights of existing shareholders were disapplied. The convertible note bore a coupon of 
5.50% and matured on November 9, 2015. 
> In June 2013, Volkswagen placed another €1.2 billion mandatory convertible note to supplement the mandatory con-
vertible note issued in November 2012. The features of this mandatory convertible note corresponded to those of the 
mandatory convertible note issued in November 2012. It was issued at a price of 105.64% of the principal amount. 
Additionally, accrued interest (€1 million) was received and deferred. This mandatory convertible note also matured on 
November 9, 2015.  
The convertible notes were settled by issuing new preferred shares no later than at maturity. The issuer was entitled to 
convert the mandatory convertible notes at any time at the minimum conversion price. The note terms and conditions also 
provided for early conversion options. This voluntary conversion right was exercised in the reporting period. In 2015, a 
further 27,091 preferred shares were created through exercise of the voluntary conversion right. At the maturity date, 
November 9, 2015, the remaining amount of both notes was converted by the issuer as required. A further 25,536,876 new 
preferred shares were created and the underlying principal amount of each bond was €100,000 and the final conversion 
price €144.50. In this context, it was necessary to reclassify the principal amount of €65 million from the capital reserves to 
subscribed capital. 
Following the voluntary and mandatory conversion of mandatory convertible notes in the reporting period, the sub-
scribed capital is composed of 295,089,818 no-par value ordinary shares and 206,205,445 no-par value preferred shares, 
and amounts to €1,283 million (December 31, 2014: €1,218 million). 
The Annual General Meeting on May 5, 2015 resolved to create authorized capital of up to €179 million, expiring on 
May 4, 2020, to issue new preferred bearer shares. 
On March 14, 2014, Volkswagen AG published an offer to the shareholders of Scania Aktiebolag, Södertälje, (“Scania”) 
to acquire all Scania shares. The offer was completed on May 13, 2014 and Volkswagen initiated a squeeze-out for the 
Scania shares that were not tendered in the course of the offer. Scania shares were delisted from the 
NASDAQ OMX 
Stockholm at the end of June 5, 2014. The Group’s retained earnings were reduced by the total value of the offer amounting 
to €6,650 million as a capital transaction with noncontrolling interest shareholders recognized directly in equity. At the 
same time, the equity interest in Scania previously attributable to the noncontrolling interest shareholders in Scania 
amounting to €2,123 million was reclassified from noncontrolling interests to the reserves attributable to the share-
holders of Volkswagen AG. For information on the acquisition of the noncontrolling interests in Scania, see also the dis-
closures on the basis of consolidation.  
In March 2014, Volkswagen AG placed unsecured subordinated hybrid notes with an aggregate principal amount of  
€3 billion via a subsidiary, Volkswagen International Finance N.V. Amsterdam/the Netherlands (
VIF). The perpetual hybrid 
notes were issued in two tranches and can be called by 
VIF. The first call date for the first tranche (€1.25 billion and a coupon 
of 3.750%) is after seven years, and the first call date for the second tranche (€1.75 billion and a coupon of 4.625%) is after 
twelve years. In March 2015, Volkswagen AG placed further unsecured subordinated hybrid notes with an aggregate 
principal amount of €2.5 billion via 
VIF. The perpetual hybrid notes were issued in two tranches and can be called by  VIF. 
The first call date for the first tranche (€1.1 billion and a coupon of 2.50%) is after seven years, and the first call date

254 for the second tranche (€1.4 billion and a coupon of 3.50%) is after 15 years. Interest may be accumulated depending on 
whether a dividend is paid to Volkswagen AG shareholders. Under 
IAS 32, the hybrid notes must be classified in their 
entirety as equity. The capital raised was recognized in equity, less a discount and transaction costs and net of deferred 
taxes. The interest payments payable to the noteholders will be recognized directly in equity, net of income taxes.

The capital reserves comprise the share premium totaling €14,225 million (previous year: €14,290 million) from capital 
increases, the share premium of €219 million from the issuance of bonds with warrants and an amount of €107 million 
appropriated on the basis of the capital reduction implemented in 2006. In the previous year, the capital reserves increased 
by €1,959 million due to the implementation of a capital increase. As the mandatory convertible notes that had been issued 
were converted in fiscal year 2015, an amount of €65,443,756 (previous year: €56,584) was reclassified from the capital 
reserves to subscribed capital (see also note 11). No amounts were withdrawn from the capital reserves. 
DIVIDEND PROPOSAL 
In accordance with section 58(2) of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act), the dividend payment by 
Volkswagen AG is based on the net retained profits reported in the annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG prepared 
in accordance with the German Commercial Code. Based on these annual financial statements of Volkswagen AG, net 
retained profits of €69 million are eligible for distribution following the withdrawal of €5,580 million from the revenue 
reserves. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting that a total 
dividend of €68 million, i.e. €0.11 per ordinary share and €0.17 per preferred share, be paid from the net retained profits. 
Shareholders are not entitled to a dividend payment until it has been resolved by the Annual General Meeting. 
A dividend of €4.80 per ordinary share and €4.86 per preferred share was distributed in fiscal year 2015. 
NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
As of December 31, 2015, total noncontrolling interests amounted to €210 million (previous year: €198 million). The 
noncontrolling interests in equity are attributable primarily to shareholders of 
RENK AG and AUDI AG and are immaterial 
individually and in the aggregate.

29. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
Provisions for pensions are recognized for commitments in the form of retirement, invalidity and dependents’ benefits 
payable under pension plans. The benefits provided by the Group vary according to the legal, tax and economic circum-
stances of the country concerned, and usually depend on the length of service and remuneration of the employees. 
Volkswagen Group companies provide occupational pensions under both defined contribution and defined benefit 
plans. In the case of defined contribution plans, the Company makes contributions to state or private pension schemes 
based on legal or contractual requirements, or on a voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, there are no 
further obligations for the Volkswagen Group. Current contributions are recognized as pension expenses of the period 
concerned. In 2015, they amounted to a total of €1,978 million (previous year: €1,815 million) in the Volkswagen Group. 
Of this figure, contributions to the compulsory state pension system in Germany amounted to €1,500 million (previous 
year: €1,410 million). 
In the case of defined benefit plans, a distinction is made between pensions funded by provisions and externally funded 
plans. 
The pension provisions for defined benefits are measured by independent actuaries using the internationally accepted 
projected unit credit method in accordance with 
IAS 19, under which the future obligations are measured on the basis of 
the ratable benefit entitlements earned as of the balance sheet date. Measurement reflects actuarial assumptions as to 
discount rates, salary and pension trends, employee turnover rates, longevity and increases in healthcare costs, which were 
determined for each Group company depending on the economic environment. Remeasurements arise from differences 
between what has actually occurred and the prior-year assumptions as well as from changes in assumptions. They are 
recognized in other comprehensive income, net of deferred taxes, in the period in which they arise. 
Multi-employer pension plans exist in the Volkswagen Group in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, the 
Netherlands and Japan. These plans are defined benefit plans. A small proportion of them are accounted for as defined 
contribution plans, as the Volkswagen Group is not authorized to receive the information required in order to account for 
them as defined benefit plans. Under the terms of the multi-employer plans, the Volkswagen Group is not liable for the 
obligations of the other employers. In the event of its withdrawal from the plans or their winding-up, the proportionate 
share of the surplus of assets attributable to the Volkswagen Group will be credited or the proportionate share of the deficit 
attributable to the Volkswagen Group will have to be funded. In the case of the defined benefit plans accounted for as 
defined contribution plans, the Volkswagen Group’s share of the obligations represents a small proportion of the total 
obligations. No probable significant risks arising from multi-employer defined benefit pension plans that are accounted 
for as defined contribution plans have been identified. The expected contributions to those plans will amount to €22 mil-
lion for fiscal year 2016.

particular are also carried under provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits. These post-employment 
benefit provisions take into account the expected long-term rise in the cost of healthcare. €19 million (previous year: €16

SIGNIFICANT PENSION ARRANGEMENTS IN THE VOLKSWAGEN GROUP 
For the period after their active working life, the Volkswagen Group offers its employees benefits under attractive, modern 
occupational pension arrangements. Most of the arrangements in the Volkswagen Group are pension plans for employees 
in Germany classified as defined benefit plans under 
IAS 19. The majority of these obligations are funded solely by 
recognized provisions. These plans are now largely closed to new members. To reduce the risks associated with defined 
benefit plans, in particular longevity, salary increases and inflation, the Volkswagen Group has introduced new defined 
benefit plans in recent years whose benefits are funded by appropriate external plan assets. The above-mentioned risks 
have been largely reduced in these pension plans. The proportion of the total defined benefit obligation attributable to 
pension obligations funded by plan assets will continue to rise in the future. The significant pension plans are described in 
the following. 
 
German pension plans funded solely by recognized provisions 
The pension plans funded solely by recognized provisions comprise both contribution-based plans with guarantees and 
final salary plans. For contribution-based plans, an annual pension expense dependent on income and status is converted 
into a lifelong pension entitlement using annuity factors (guaranteed modular pension entitlements). The annuity factors 
include a guaranteed rate of interest. At retirement, the modular pension entitlements earned annually are added together. 
For final salary plans, the underlying salary is multiplied at retirement by a percentage that depends on the years of service 
up until the retirement date. 
The present value of the guaranteed obligation rises as interest rates fall and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk. 
The pension system provides for lifelong pension payments. The companies bear the longevity risk in this respect. This 
is accounted for by calculating the annuity factors and the present value of the guaranteed obligation using the latest 
generational mortality tables – the “Heubeck 2005 G” mortality tables – which already reflect future increases in life expec-
tancy. 
To reduce the inflation risk from adjusting the regular pension payments by the rate of inflation, a pension adjustment 
that is not indexed to inflation was introduced for pension plans where this is permitted by law.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
259  German pension plans funded by external plan assets 
The pension plans funded by external plan assets are contribution-based plans with guarantees. In this case, an annual 
pension expense dependent on income and status is either converted into a lifelong pension entitlement using annuity 
factors (guaranteed modular pension entitlement) or paid out in a single lump sum or in installments. In some cases, 
employees also have the opportunity to provide for their own retirement through deferred compensation. The annuity 
factors include a guaranteed rate of interest. At retirement, the modular pension entitlements earned annually are added 
together. The pension expense is contributed on an ongoing basis to a separate pool of assets that is administered indepen-
dently of the Company in trust and invested in the capital markets. If the plan assets exceed the present value of the 
obligations calculated using the guaranteed rate of interest, surpluses are allocated (modular pension bonuses). 
Since the assets administered in trust meet the 
IAS 19 criteria for classification as plan assets, they are deducted from 
the obligations. 
The amount of the pension assets is exposed to general market risk. The investment strategy and its implementation 
are therefore continuously monitored by the trusts’ governing bodies, on which the companies are also represented. For 
example, investment policies are stipulated in investment guidelines with the aim of limiting market risk and its impact on 
plan assets. In addition, asset-liability management studies are conducted if required so as to ensure that investments are 
in line with the obligations that need to be covered. The pension assets are currently invested primarily in fixed-income or 
equity funds. The main risks are therefore interest rate and equity price risk. To mitigate market risk, the pension system 
also provides for cash funds to be set aside in an equalization reserve before any surplus is allocated. 
The present value of the obligation is the present value of the guaranteed obligation after deducting the plan assets. If 
the plan assets fall below the present value of the guaranteed obligation, a provision must be recognized in that amount. 
The present value of the guaranteed obligation rises as interest rates fall and is therefore exposed to interest rate risk. 
In the case of lifelong pension payments, the Volkswagen Group bears the longevity risk. This is accounted for by 
calculating the annuity factors and the present value of the guaranteed obligation using the latest generational mortality 
tables – the “Heubeck 2005 G” mortality tables – which already reflect future increases in life expectancy. In addition, the 
independent actuaries carry out annual risk monitoring as part of the review of the assets administered by the trusts. 
To reduce the inflation risk from adjusting the regular pension payments by the rate of inflation, a pension adjustment 
that is not indexed to inflation was introduced for pension plans where this is permitted by law. 
Calculation of the pension provisions was based on the following actuarial assumptions:

260 These assumptions are averages that were weighted using the present value of the defined benefit obligation. 
With regard to life expectancy, consideration is given to the latest mortality tables in each country. 
The discount rates are generally defined to reflect the yields on prime-rated corporate bonds with matching maturities 
and currencies. The iBoxx AA 10+ Corporates index was taken as the basis for the obligations of German Group companies. 
Similar indices were used for foreign pension obligations. 
The payroll trends cover expected wage and salary trends, which also include increases attributable to career 
development. 
The pension trends either reflect the contractually guaranteed pension adjustments or are based on the rules on 
pension adjustments in force in each country.  
The employee turnover rates are based on past experience and future expectations.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
262 The sensitivity analysis shown above considers the change in one assumption at a time, leaving the other assumptions 
unchanged versus the original calculation, i.e. any correlation effects between the individual assumptions are ignored. 
To examine the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to a change in assumed longevity, the estimates of mortality 
were reduced as part of a comparative calculation to the extent that doing so increases life expectancy by approximately one 
year. 
The average duration of the defined benefit obligation weighted by the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
(Macaulay duration) is 19 years (previous year: 19 years). 
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is attributable as follows to the members of the plan:

*  Prior-year figures adjusted due to the separate presentation of the provisions for litigation and legal risks. 
The obligations arising from sales contain provisions covering all risks relating to the sale of vehicles, components and 
genuine parts through to the disposal of end-of-life vehicles. They primarily comprise warranty obligations, calculated on 
the basis of losses to date and estimated future losses. They also include provisions for discounts, bonuses and similar 
allowances which are incurred after the balance sheet date, but for which there is a legal or constructive obligation attri-
butable to sales revenue before the balance sheet date. 
The increase in obligations arising from sales is largely due to the recognition of provisions for the implementation of 
field measures and of repurchases in connection with the diesel issue. Please refer to the “Key events” section for further 
information. 
Provisions for employee expenses are recognized for long-service awards, time credits, partial retirement arrange-
ments, severance payments and similar obligations, among other things.  
The increase in the provisions for litigation and legal risks results primarily from the provisions recognized in con-
nection with the diesel issue to cover currently known legal risks, including appropriate legal defense and legal advice 
expenses amounting to €7.0 billion. These are subject to what are in part considerable estimation risks because the com-
prehensive and extensive investigations are still at an early stage, the factors involved are so complex, and the discussions 
with the authorities are still ongoing. In addition, the provisions for litigation and legal risks contain amounts relating to a 
large number of legal disputes and official proceedings in which Volkswagen Group companies become involved in Ger-
many and internationally in the course of their operating activities. In particular, such legal disputes and other proceedings 
may occur in relation to suppliers, dealers, customers, employees, or investors. Please refer to the “Litigation” section for a 
discussion of the legal risks.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
265  Miscellaneous provisions relate to a wide range of identifiable specific risks, price risks and uncertain obligations, which 
are measured in the amount of the expected settlement value. 
Miscellaneous provisions include provisions amounting to €459 million (previous year: €417 million) relating to the 
insurance business. 
31. Put options and compensation rights granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders 
This balance sheet item consists primarily of the present value of the cash settlement in accordance with section 305 of the 
Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) offered to 
MAN shareholders in connection with the control and profit 
and loss transfer agreement, including the basic interest rate in accordance with section 247 of the Bürgerliches Gesetz-
buch (
BGB – German Civil Code) assumed until the end of the award proceedings. The Annual General Meeting of  MAN SE 
approved the conclusion of a control and profit and loss transfer agreement between 
MAN SE and Volkswagen Truck & Bus 
GmbH, a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, in June 2013. The agreement sets out that the noncontrolling interest shareholders 
of 
MAN SE are entitled to either a cash settlement in accordance with section 305 of the AktG amounting to €80.89 per 
tendered ordinary or preferred share, or cash compensation in accordance with section 304 of the AktG in the amount of 
€3.07 per ordinary or preferred share (after corporate taxes, before the shareholder’s individual tax liability) for each full 
fiscal year. In July 2013, award proceedings were instituted to review the appropriateness of the cash settlement set out in 
the agreement in accordance with section 305 of the AktG and the cash compensation in accordance with section 304 of 
the AktG. In July 2015, the Munich Regional Court ruled in the first instance that the amount of the cash settlement 
payable to the noncontrolling interest shareholders of 
MAN should be increased from €80.89 to €90.29; at the same time, 
the amount of the cash compensation was confirmed. The ruling is not yet legally effective, and both parties to the pro-
ceedings have since appealed. Volkswagen continues to maintain that the results of the valuation are correct. The 
appropriateness of the valuation was confirmed by the audit firms and by the court-appointed auditor of the agreement. As 
a precaution, the measurement was adjusted to the higher settlement payable, resulting in an expense of €437 million, 
which was recognized in the other financial result.

RECONCILIATION OF BALANCE SHEET ITEMS TO CLASSES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The following table shows the reconciliation of the balance sheet items to the relevant classes of financial instruments, 
broken down by the carrying amount and fair value of the financial instruments.  
The fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost, such as receivables and liabilities, is calculated by 
discounting using a market rate of interest for a similar risk and matching maturity. For reasons of materiality, the fair value 
of current balance sheet items is generally deemed to be their carrying amount.

Uniform valuation techniques and inputs are used to measure fair value. The fair value of Level 2 and 3 financial instru-
ments is measured in the individual divisions on the basis of Group-wide specifications. The measurement techniques 
used are explained in the disclosures on “accounting policies”. The fair value of put options and compensation rights 
granted to noncontrolling interest shareholders is calculated using a present value model based on the cash settlement 
determined by the Munich Regional Court in the award proceedings, including cash compensation, as well as the 
minimum statutory interest rate and a risk-adjusted discount rate for a matching maturity. For further information, please 
see note 31. The fair value of Level 3 receivables was measured by reference to individual expectations of losses;

The allocation of fair values to the three levels in the fair value hierarchy is based on the availability of observable market 
prices. Level 1 is used to report the fair value of financial instruments for which a price is directly available in an active 
market. Examples include marketable securities and other equity investments measured at fair value. Fair values in Level 2, 
for example of derivatives, are measured on the basis of observable market inputs using market-based valuation 
techniques. In particular, the inputs used include exchange rates, yield curves and commodity prices that are observable in 
the relevant markets and obtained through pricing services. Level 3 fair values are calculated using valuation techniques 
that incorporate inputs that are not observable in active markets. In the Volkswagen Group, long-term commodity futures 
are allocated to Level 3 because the prices available on the market must be extrapolated for measurement purposes. This is 
done on the basis of observable inputs obtained for the different commodities through pricing services. Options on equity 
instruments and residual value protection models are also reported in Level 3. Equity instruments are measured primarily 
using the relevant business plans and entity-specific discount rates. The significant inputs used to measure fair value for 
the residual value protection models include forecasts and estimates of used vehicle residual values for the appropriate 
models.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
273  The transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the respective reporting dates. The transfers out 
of Level 3 into Level 2 comprise commodity futures for which observable quoted prices are now available for measurement 
purposes due to the decline in their remaining maturities; consequently, no extrapolation is required. There were no 
transfers between other levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
Commodity prices are the key risk variable for the fair value of commodity futures. Sensitivity analyses are used to 
present the effect of changes in commodity prices on earnings after tax and equity.  
If commodity prices for commodity futures classified as Level 3 had been 10% higher (lower) as of December 31, 
2015, earnings after tax would have been €6 million (previous year: €20 million) higher (lower) and equity would have 
been €2 million (previous year: €4 million) higher (lower). 
The key risk variable for measuring options on equity instruments held by the Company is the relevant enterprise 
value. Sensitivity analyses are used to present the effect of changes in risk variables on earnings after tax. 
If the assumed enterprise values had been 10% higher, earnings after tax would have been €1 million (previous year: 
€1 million) higher. If the assumed enterprise values had been 10% lower, earnings after tax would have been €1 million 
(previous year: €2 million) lower. 
Residual value risks result from hedging agreements with dealers under which earnings effects caused by market-
related fluctuations in residual values that arise from buy-back obligations under leases are borne in part by the Volks-
wagen Group.  
The key risk variable influencing the fair value of the options relating to residual value risks is used car prices. 
Sensitivity analyses are used to quantify the effects of changes in used car prices on earnings after tax. 
If the prices for the used cars covered by the residual value protection model had been 10% higher as of December 31, 
2015, earnings after tax would have been €219 million higher. If the prices for the used cars covered by the residual value 
protection model had been 10% lower as of December 31, 2015, earnings after tax would have been €219 million lower.

FACTORING AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS 
The trade receivables include transferred receivables in the total amount of €–  million (previous year: €4 million) that were 
not derecognized in their entirety because the credit risk remains with the Volkswagen Group. The total purchase price 
received of €–
 million (previous year: €1 million) is reported in financial liabilities. The fair values of the receivables and 
liabilities are not materially different to their carrying amounts. 
Asset-backed securities transactions amounting to €23,245 million (previous year: €19,301 million) entered into to 
refinance the financial services business are included in bonds, commercial paper and notes, and liabilities from loans. 
The corresponding carrying amount of the receivables from the customer and dealer financing and the finance lease 
business amounted to €26,415 million (previous year: €21,485 million). Collateral of €34,717 million (previous year: 
€28,192 million) in total was furnished as part of asset-backed securities transactions. The expected payments were 
assigned to structured entities and the equitable liens in the financed vehicles were transferred. These asset-backed 
securities transactions did not result in the receivables from financial services business being derecognized, as the Group 
retains nonpayment and late payment risks. The difference between the assigned receivables and the related liabilities is 
the result of different terms and conditions and the share of the securitized paper and notes held by the Volkswagen Group 
itself, as well as the proportion of vehicles financed within the Group. 
Most of the public and private asset-backed securities transactions of the Volkswagen Group can be repaid in advance 
(clean-up call) if less than 9% or 10%, as appropriate, of the original transaction volume is outstanding. The assigned 
receivables cannot be assigned again or pledged elsewhere as collateral. The claims of the holders of commercial paper 
and notes are limited to the assigned receivables and the receipts from those receivables are earmarked for the repayment 
of the corresponding liability. 
As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of the assigned receivables still recognized in the balance sheet was €25,161 
million (previous year: €22,102 million). The fair value of the related liabilities was €23,000 million (previous year: 
€19,480 million) at that reporting date.  
The Volkswagen Financial Services AG Group is contractually obliged under certain conditions to transfer funds to the 
structured entities that are included in its consolidated financial statements. Since the receivables are transferred to the 
special purpose entity by way of undisclosed assignment, the situation may occur in which the receivable has already been 
reduced in a legally binding manner at the originator, for example if the obligor effectively offsets it against receivables 
owed to it by a company belonging to the Volkswagen Group. In this case, collateral must be furnished for the resulting 
compensation claims against the special purpose entity, for example if the rating of the Group company concerned 
declines to a contractually agreed reference value.

277  OTHER DISCLOSURES 
33. Cash flow statement 
Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement classified into cash flows from operating activities, investing activities 
and financing activities, irrespective of the balance sheet classification. 
Cash flows from operating activities are derived indirectly from earnings before tax. Earnings before tax are adjusted 
to eliminate noncash expenditures (mainly depreciation, amortization and impairment losses) and income. Other noncash 
income and expense results mainly from measurement effects in connection with financial insruments and to fair value 
changes relating to hedging transactions (see note 9). This results in cash flows from operating activities after accounting 
for changes in working capital, which also include changes in lease assets and in financial services receivables. 
Investing activities include additions to property, plant and equipment and equity investments, additions to capitalized 
development costs and investments in securities and loans. 
Financing activities include outflows of funds from dividend payments and redemption of bonds, inflows from the 
capital increase and issuance of bonds, and changes in other financial liabilities. Please refer to note 24 for information on 
the inflows from the issuance of hybrid capital amounting to €2,457 million (previous year: from the issuance of new 
preferred shares in the amount of €1,980 million and the issuance of hybrid capital in the amount of €2,952 million) 
contained in the capital contributions. 
The changes in balance sheet items that are presented in the cash flow statement cannot be derived directly from the 
balance sheet, as the effects of currency translation and changes in the consolidated Group are noncash transactions and 
are therefore eliminated. 
In 2015, cash flows from operating activities include interest received amounting to €6,619 million (previous year: 
€6,129 million) and interest paid amounting to €2,440 million (previous year: €3,397 million). In addition, the share of 
profits and losses of equity-accounted investments (note 7) includes dividends amounting to €4,683 million (previous year: 
€2,997 million).  
Dividends amounting to €2,294 million (previous year: €1,871 million) were paid to Volkswagen AG shareholders.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
278 34. Financial risk management and financial instruments 
1. HEDGING GUIDELINES AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES 
The principles and responsibilities for managing and controlling the risks that could arise from financial instruments are 
defined by the Board of Management and monitored by the Supervisory Board. General rules apply to the Group-wide risk 
policy; these are oriented on the statutory requirements and the “Minimum Requirements for Risk Management by Credit 
Institutions”. 
Group Treasury is responsible for operational risk management and control of risks from the financial instruments it 
itself administers. The main functions of the 
MAN and PHS subgroups are included in Group Treasury’s operational risk 
management and control for risks relating to financial instruments, while the Scania subgroup is only included to an 
extremely limited extent. All of these subgroups also have their own risk management structures. The Executive Committee 
for Liquidity and Foreign Currency is regularly informed about current financial risks. In addition, the Group Board of 
Management and the Supervisory Board are regularly updated on the current risk situation. 
For more information, please see the management report on page 185-186. 
2. CREDIT AND DEFAULT RISK 
The credit and default risk arising from financial assets involves the risk of default by counterparties, and therefore com-
prises at a maximum the amount of the claims under carrying amounts receivable from them and the irrevocable credit 
commitments. The maximum potential credit and default risk is reduced by collateral held and other credit enhancements 
in the amount of €74,115 million (previous year: €66,555 million). The collateral held relates solely to financial assets 
carried at amortized cost and mainly serves to secure financial services receivables and trade receivables. Collateral com-
prises vehicles and assets transferred as security, as well as guarantees and real property liens. Cash collateral is also used 
in hedging transactions. The risk arising from nonderivative financial instruments is also accounted for by recognizing 
bad debt losses. Significant cash and capital investments, as well as derivatives, are only entered into with national and 
international banks of good credit standing. Risk is additionally limited by a limit system based primarily on the equity base 
of the counterparties concerned and on credit assessments by international rating agencies. Financial guarantees issued 
also give rise to credit and default risk. The maximum potential credit and default risk is calculated from the amount Volks-
wagen would have to pay if claims were to be asserted under the guarantees. The corresponding amounts are presented in 
the Liquidity risk section. 
There were no material concentrations of risk at individual counterparties or counterparty groups in the past fiscal 
year due to the global allocation of the Group’s business activities and the resulting diversification. There was hardly any 
change in the concentration of credit and default risk exposures to the German public banking sector as a whole that has 
arisen from Group-wide cash and capital investments as well as derivatives: the portion attributable to this sector was 9.7% 
at the end of 2015 compared with 12.1% (adjusted) at the end of 2014. Any existing concentration of risk is assessed and 
monitored both at the level of individual counterparties or counterparty groups and with regard to the countries in which 
these are based, in each case using the share of all credit and default risk exposures accounted for by the risk exposure 
concerned.

Collateral that was accepted for financial assets in the current fiscal year was recognized in the balance sheet in the 
amount of €90 million (previous year: €94 million). This mainly relates to vehicles.  
3. LIQUIDITY RISK 
The solvency and liquidity of the Volkswagen Group are ensured at all times by rolling liquidity planning, a liquidity reserve 
in the form of cash, confirmed credit lines and the issuance of securities on the international money and capital markets. 
The volume of confirmed credit lines was increased significantly by a syndicated credit line entered into in the amount of 
€20 billion. 
Local cash funds in certain countries (e.g. Brazil, Argentina, Ukraine, Malaysia, India and Taiwan) are only available to 
the Group for cross-border transactions subject to exchange controls. There are no significant restrictions over and above 
these.

When calculating cash outflows related to put options and compensation rights, it was assumed that shares would be 
tendered at the earliest possible repayment date. 
Derivatives comprise both cash flows from derivative financial instruments with negative fair values and cash flows 
from derivatives with positive fair values for which gross settlement has been agreed. The cash outflows from derivatives 
for which gross settlement has been agreed are matched in part by cash inflows. These cash inflows are not reported in the 
maturity analysis. If these cash inflows were also recognized, the cash outflows presented would be substantially lower. 
The cash outflows from irrevocable credit commitments are presented in note 38, classified by contractual maturities. 
As of December 31, 2015, the maximum potential liability under financial guarantees amounted to €1,638 million 
(previous year adjusted: €1,399 million). Financial guarantees are assumed to be due immediately in all cases. They relate 
primarily to the pledge of claims under certificates of deposit with Bankhaus Metzler amounting to €1.3 billion (previous 
year: €1.4 billion) to secure a loan granted to Fleet Investments B.V. by Bankhaus Metzler (see disclosures on the basis of 
consolidation/joint ventures). This was disclosed under “Contingent liabilities” in the previous year. The prior-period dis-
closure was adjusted accordingly. 
4. MARKET RISK 
4.1 Hedging policy and financial derivatives 
During the course of its general business activities, the Volkswagen Group is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, 
commodity price, equity price and fund price risk. Corporate policy is to limit or eliminate such risk by means of hedging. 
All necessary hedging transactions with the exception of the Scania, 
MAN and Porsche Holding GmbH (Salzburg) sub-
groups are executed or coordinated centrally by Group Treasury. There were no significant risk concentrations in the past 
fiscal year. 
The following table shows the gains and losses on hedges:

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
282 The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges represents the income and expenses from changes in the fair value of hedging 
instruments that exceed the changes in the fair value of the hedged items but that are documented to be within the per-
mitted range of 80% to 125% overall when measuring effectiveness. Such income or expenses are recognized directly in 
the financial result. 
In 2015, €3,864 million (previous year: €298 million), in both cases reducing earnings, from the cash flow hedge 
reserve was transferred to the other operating result, while €3 million (previous year: €2 million, increasing earnings) was 
transferred to the financial result, reducing earnings, and €90 million (previous year: €27 million), in both cases reducing 
earnings, was included in the cost of sales. 
The Volkswagen Group uses two different methods to present market risk from nonderivative and derivative financial 
instruments in accordance with 
IFRS 7. For quantitative risk measurement, interest rate and foreign currency risk in the 
Volkswagen Financial Services subgroup are measured using a value-at-risk (VaR) model on the basis of a historical simu-
lation, while market risk in the other Group companies is determined using a sensitivity analysis. The value-at-risk calcu-
lation indicates the size of the maximum potential loss on the portfolio as a whole within a time horizon of 40 days, 
measured at a confidence level of 99%. To provide the basis for this calculation, all cash flows from nonderivative and 
derivative financial instruments are aggregated into an interest rate gap analysis. The historical market data used in 
calculating value at risk covers a period of 1,000 trading days. The sensitivity analysis calculates the effect on equity and 
profit or loss by modifying risk variables within the respective market risks. 
4.2 Market risk in the Volkswagen Group (excluding Volkswagen Financial Services) 
4.2.1 Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency risk in the Volkswagen Group (excluding Volkswagen Financial Services) is attributable to investments, 
financing measures and operating activities. Currency forwards, currency options, currency swaps and cross-currency 
swaps are used to limit foreign currency risk. These transactions relate to the exchange rate hedging of all material pay-
ments covering general business activities that are not made in the functional currency of the respective Group companies. 
The principle of matching currencies applies to the Group’s financing activities. 
Hedging transactions entered into in 2015 as part of foreign currency risk management related primarily to the 
Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, sterling, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee, the Japanese yen, the Canadian 
dollar, the Mexican peso, the Polish zloty, the Russian ruble, the Swedish krona, the Swiss franc, the Singapore dollar, the 
South African rand, the South Korean won, the Taiwan dollar, the Czech koruna, the Hungarian forint and the US dollar.  
All nonfunctional currencies in which the Volkswagen Group enters into financial instruments are included as 
relevant risk variables in the sensitivity analysis in accordance with 
IFRS 7. 
If the functional currencies concerned had appreciated or depreciated by 10% against the other currencies, the 
exchange rates shown below would have resulted in the following effects on the hedging reserve in equity and on earnings 
after tax. It is not appropriate to add together the individual figures, since the results of the various functional currencies 
concerned are based on different scenarios.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
284 4.2.2 Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk in the Volkswagen Group (excluding Volkswagen Financial Services) results from changes in market 
interest rates, primarily for medium- and long-term variable interest receivables and liabilities. Interest rate swaps and 
cross-currency swaps are entered into to hedge against this risk primarily under fair value or cash flow hedges, and 
depending on market conditions. Intragroup financing arrangements are mainly structured to match the maturities of their 
refinancing. Departures from the Group standard are subject to centrally defined limits and monitored on an ongoing 
basis. 
Interest rate risk within the meaning of 
IFRS 7 is calculated for these companies using sensitivity analyses. The effects 
of the risk-variable market rates of interest on the financial result and on equity are presented, net of tax.  
If market interest rates had been 100 bps higher as of December 31, 2015, equity would have been €71 million (pre-
vious year: €108 million) lower. If market interest rates had been 100 bps lower as of December 31, 2015, equity would have 
been €69 million (previous year: €106 million) higher. 
If market interest rates had been 100 bps higher as of December 31, 2015, earnings after tax would have been €81 mil-
lion (previous year: €43 million) higher. If market interest rates had been 100 bps lower as of December 31, 2015, 
earnings after tax would have been €95 million (previous year: €55 million) lower. 
4.2.3 Commodity price risk 
Commodity price risk in the Volkswagen Group (excluding Volkswagen Financial Services) primarily results from price 
fluctuations and the availability of nonferrous metals and precious metals, as well as of coal, CO
2 certificates and rubber. 
Forward transactions and swaps are entered into to limit these risks. 
Hedge accounting in accordance with 
IAS 39 was applied in some cases to the hedging of commodity risk associated 
with aluminum and coal. 
Commodity price risk within the meaning of 
IFRS 7 is presented using sensitivity analyses. These show the effect on 
earnings after tax and equity of changes in risk variables in the form of commodity prices.  
If the commodity prices of the hedged nonferrous metals, coal and rubber had been 10% higher (lower) as of Decem-
ber 31, 2015, earnings after tax would have been €75 million (previous year: €126 million) higher (lower). 
If the commodity prices of the hedging transactions accounted for using hedge accounting had been 10% higher 
(lower) as of December 31, 2015, equity would have been €41 million (previous year: €55 million) higher (lower). 
4.2.4 Equity and bond price risk 
The Spezialfonds (special funds) launched using surplus liquidity and the equity interests measured at fair value are 
subject in particular to equity price and bond price risk, which can arise from fluctuations in quoted market prices, stock 
exchange indices and market rates of interest. The changes in bond prices resulting from variations in the market rates of 
interest are quantified in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, as are the measurement of foreign currency and other interest rate risks 
arising from the special funds and the equity interests measured at fair value. As a rule, we counter the risks arising from 
the special funds by ensuring a broad diversification of products, issuers and regional markets when investing funds, as 
stipulated by our Investment Guidelines. In addition, we use exchange rate hedges in the form of futures contracts when 
market conditions are appropriate.  
As part of the presentation of market risk, 
IFRS 7 requires disclosures on how hypothetical changes in risk variables 
affect the price of financial instruments. Potential risk variables here are in particular quoted market prices or indices, as 
well as interest rate changes as bond price parameters.  
If share prices had been 10% higher as of December 31, 2015, equity would have been €53 million (previous year: 
€259 million) higher. If share prices had been 10% lower as of December 31, 2015, equity would have been €61 million 
(previous year: €275 million) lower. 
4.3 Market risk at Volkswagen Financial Services 
Exchange rate risk in the Volkswagen Financial Services subgroup is mainly attributable to assets that are not denominated 
in the functional currency and from refinancing within operating activities. Interest rate risk relates to refinancing without 
matching maturities and the varying interest rate elasticity of individual asset and liability items. The risks are limited by 
the use of currency and interest rate hedges. 
  ",,,,,,,,,,
316,"   
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
285  Microhedges and portfolio hedges are used for interest rate hedging. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities included in the 
hedging strategy are recognized at fair value, as opposed to their original subsequent measurement at amortized cost. The 
resulting effects in the income statement are offset by the corresponding gains and losses on the interest rate hedging 
instruments (swaps). Currency hedges (currency forwards and cross-currency swaps) are used to mitigate foreign currency 
risk. All cash flows in foreign currency are hedged.  
As of December 31, 2015, the value at risk was €179 million (previous year: €98 million) for interest rate risk and €196 
million (previous year: €112 million) for foreign currency risk. 
The entire value at risk for interest rate and foreign currency risk at the Volkswagen Financial Services subgroup was 
€245 million (previous year: €179 million). 
5. METHODS FOR MONITORING HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS 
In the Volkswagen Group, hedge effectiveness is assessed prospectively using the critical terms match method and using 
statistical methods in the form of a regression analysis. Retrospective analysis of effectiveness uses effectiveness tests in the 
form of the dollar offset method or a regression analysis. 
Under the dollar offset method, the changes in value of the hedged item expressed in monetary units are compared with 
the changes in value of the hedging instrument expressed in monetary units. 
Where regression analysis is used, the change in value of the hedged item is presented as an independent variable, and 
that of the hedging instrument as a dependent variable. Hedge relationships are classified as effective if they have suffi-
cient coefficients of determination and slope factors.

35. Capital management 
The Group’s capital management ensures that its goals and strategies can be achieved in the interests of shareholders, 
employees and other stakeholders. In particular, management focuses on generating the minimum return on invested 
assets in the Automotive Division that is required by the capital markets, and on increasing the return on equity in the 
Financial Services Division. In the process, it aims overall to achieve the highest possible growth in the value of the Group 
and its divisions for the benefit of all the Company’s stakeholder groups. 
In order to maximize the use of resources in the Automotive Division and to measure the success of this, we have for a 
number of years been using a value-based management system, with value contribution as an absolute performance 
measure and return on investment (
ROI) as a relative indicator. 
Value contribution is defined as the difference between operating profit after tax and the opportunity cost of invested 
capital. The opportunity cost of capital is calculated by multiplying the market cost of capital by average invested capital. 
Invested capital is calculated by taking the operating assets reported in the balance sheet (property, plant and equipment, 
intangible assets, lease assets, inventories and receivables) and deducting non-interest-bearing liabilities (trade payables 
and payments on account received). Average invested capital is derived from the balance at the beginning and the end of 
the reporting period. The Automotive Division generated a negative value contribution of €–5,935 million in the reporting 
period; this represents a significant deterioration compared with the prior-year figure because of the charges relating to 
the special items recognized in operating result. 
The return on investment (
ROI) is defined as the return on invested capital for a particular period based on the 
operating result after tax. If the return on investment exceeds the market cost of capital, there is an increase in the value of 
the invested capital and a positive value contribution. In the Group, we have defined a minimum required rate of return on 
invested capital of 9%, which applies to both the business units and the individual products and product lines. The return 
on investment therefore serves as a consistent target in operational and strategic management and is used to measure 
target attainment for the Automotive Division, the individual business units, and projects and products. The return on 
investment achieved for the Automotive Division in the reporting period was –0.2%. This was significantly lower than both 
our cost of capital of 6.8% and our minimum required rate of return of 9% due to the special items recognized in operating 
result. 
Due to the specific features of the Financial Services Division, its management focuses on return on equity, a special 
target linked to invested capital. This measure is calculated as the ratio of earnings before tax to average equity. Average 
equity is calculated from the balance at the beginning and the end of the reporting period. In addition, the goals of the",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
287  Financial Services Division are to meet the banking supervisory authorities’ regulatory capital requirements, to procure 
equity for the growth planned in the coming fiscal years and to support its external rating by ensuring capital adequacy. To 
ensure compliance with prudential requirements at all times, a planning procedure integrated into internal reporting has 
been put in place at Volkswagen Financial Services, allowing the required equity to be continuously determined on the 
basis of actual and expected business performance. In the reporting period, this again ensured that regulatory minimum 
capital requirements were always met both at Group level and at the level of subordinate companies’ individual, specific 
capital requirements. 
The return on investment and value contribution in the Automotive Division as well as the return on equity in the 
Financial Services Division are shown in the following table:

  ",,,,,,,,,,
319,"  
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
288 Financial guarantee contracts within the meaning of  IFRS 7 are now presented in the Liquidity risk section in note 34 and 
are no longer included in liabilities from guarantees. Starting in fiscal year 2015, the pledge of claims under certificates of 
deposit with Bankhaus Metzler to secure a loan granted to Fleet Investments B.V. by Bankhaus Metzler is presented under 
liquidity risks in note 34. In the previous year, this was contained in assets pledged as security for third-party liabilities. The 
prior-year disclosure was adjusted accordingly.  
The other contingent liabilities are attributable primarily to potential liabilities arising from matters relating to taxes 
and customs duties, as well as to litigation and proceedings relating to suppliers, dealers, customers and employees. 
The other contingent liabilities at €1 billion contain potential settlements under product-related claims, investor 
lawsuits, and possible fines or other monetary sanctions resulting from administrative proceedings and proceedings 
involving other administrative-type authorities in connection with the diesel issue, provided that the criteria for disclosing 
a contingent liability have been met. As a general principle, they do not include any class action lawsuits and criminal 
investigations/misdemeanour proceedings related to the diesel issue filed outside of the 
USA and Canada, as well as 
specific portions of investor lawsuits which meet the definition of a contingent liability but could not, as a rule, be disclosed 
because it is impossible to measure the amount involved. These proceedings are still at a very early stage, meaning that in a 
number of cases the plaintiffs have so far not specified the basis of their claims and/or there is insufficient certainty about 
the number of plaintiffs or the amounts being claimed. 
In 2011, the European Commission opened antitrust proceedings against European truck manufacturers including 
MAN and Scania. In November 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objections to  MAN, Scania and the 
other truck manufacturers concerned, in which it informed the truck manufacturers of the objections raised against them 
and gave them the right to comment extensively on the objections raised and to exercise other rights of defense before any 
decision is reached. Because the investigation is still ongoing and due to the associated uncertainties, Volkswagen is not 
currently in a position to predict the decisions of the authorities and thus any potential fines. 
As permitted by 
IAS 37.92, in order not to prejudice the outcomes of the proceedings and the interests of the Company, 
we have not made any further disclosures about estimates in connection with the financial effects of, and disclosures about, 
uncertainty regarding the timing or amount of contingent liabilities in connection with the diesel issue and investigations 
by the European Commission. Further information can be found in note 37 “Litigation”. 
37. Litigation 
In the course of their operating activities, Volkswagen AG and the companies in which it is directly or indirectly invested 
become involved in a great number of legal disputes and official proceedings in Germany and internationally. In 
particular, such legal disputes and other proceedings may occur in relation to suppliers, dealers, customers, employees, or 
investors. For the companies involved, these may result in payment or other obligations. Above all in cases where US 
customers in particular assert claims for vehicle defects individually or by way of a class action, highly cost-intensive 
measures may have to be taken and substantial compensation or punitive damages paid. Corresponding risks also result 
from US patent infringement proceedings.  
Risks may also emerge in connection with the adherence to regulatory requirements. This particularly applies in the 
case of regulatory vagueness that may be interpreted differently by Volkswagen and the agencies responsible for the 
respective regulations. In addition, legal risks can arise from the criminal activities of individual persons, which even the 
best compliance system can never completely prevent. 
Where transparent and economically viable, adequate insurance cover is taken out for these risks. For the identifiable 
and measurable risks, appropriate provisions are recognized and information about contingent liabilities is disclosed. As 
some risks cannot be assessed or can only be assessed to a limited extent, the possibility of loss or damage not being 
covered by the insured amounts and provisions cannot be ruled out. This particularly applies to legal risk assessment 
regarding the diesel issue.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
289  Diesel Issue  
On September 18, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA) publicly announced in a “Notice of Violation” 
that irregularities in relation to nitrogen oxide (NO
x) emissions had been discovered in emissions tests on certain vehicles 
with Volkswagen Group diesel engines. It has been alleged that we had used undisclosed engine management software 
installed in certain four-cylinder diesel engines used in certain 2009 to 2015 model year vehicles to circumvent NO
x 
emissions testing regulations in the United States of America in order to comply with certification requirements. The US 
environmental authority of California – the California Air Resources Board (
CARB) – announced its own enforcement inves-
tigation in this context. 
Volkswagen admitted to irregularities in this context. In its ad hoc release dated September 22, 2015, the Volkswagen 
Group announced that noticeable discrepancies between the figures achieved in testing and in actual road use had been 
identified in around eleven million vehicles worldwide with certain diesel engines. The vast majority of these engines are 
Type EA 189 Euro 5 engines. On November 2, 2015, the 
EPA issued another “Notice of Violation” alleging that irregu-
larities had also been discovered in the software installed in vehicles with type V6 
TDI 3.0 l diesel engines.  CARB also issued 
a letter announcing its own enforcement investigation in this context. Audi has confirmed that a total of three auxiliary 
emission control devices were inadequately disclosed in the course of the US approval documentation. Around 113 
thousand vehicles from the 2009 to 2016 model years with certain six-cylinder diesel engines are affected. 
On January 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (
DOJ), on behalf of the  EPA, filed a civil complaint against Volks-
wagen AG, 
AUDI AG and other companies of the Volkswagen Group. The claims asserted under civil law are founded on the 
alleged use of illegal (Defeat Device) software in violation of the American Clean Air Act. The complaint’s allegations relate 
to both the four-cylinder and the six-cylinder diesel engines. On January 12, 2016, it was announced that 
CARB intends to 
seek civil fines for alleged violations of the California Health & Safety Code and various 
CARB regulations.  
The allegations described are subject to extensive ongoing discussions between Volkswagen and the 
EPA or CARB, 
respectively, also including a rigorous review of relevant technical concepts. The investigations have not been completed at 
the present time.  
In addition to internal inquiries, Volkswagen AG commissioned an official external investigation by US law firm Jones 
Day for this purpose. This will be an independent and comprehensive investigation that will address the diesel issue. The 
Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG is ensuring that Jones Day can carry out its clarification work independently. Jones 
Day is updating the Company on the current results of its investigation on an ongoing basis. 
The Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG has formed a special committee to coordinate all activities in this context for 
the Supervisory Board. 
Based on decisions dated October 15, 2015, the Kraftfahrtbundesamt (
KBA – German Federal Motor Transport 
Authority) ordered the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and 
SEAT brands to recall all of the 
diesel vehicles that had been issued with vehicle type approval by the 
KBA from among the 11 million affected. The recall 
concerns the member states of the European Union (EU28). On December 10, 2015 a similar decision was issued 
regarding Audi vehicles with the EA 189 engine. The timetable and action plan forming the basis for the recall order 
correspond to the proposals presented in advance by Volkswagen. Depending on the technical complexity of the remedial 
actions, this means that Volkswagen has been recalling the affected vehicles, of which there are around 8.5 million in total 
in the EU 28 countries, to the service workshops since January 2016. Based on current knowledge, the remedial actions 
differ in scope depending on the engine variant. The technical solutions cover software and in some cases hardware 
modifications, depending on the series and model year. The details of the remedial actions will be agreed in close 
cooperation with the 
KBA, which must approve them in advance. Discussions are currently underway with the authorities 
in the other EU member states with the aim of ensuring that no legal actions above and beyond this will be taken in this 
connection by public authorities in the other member states. The Group brands 
SEAT and ŠKODA also received approvals 
in principle each from their respective type approval authorities – the Ministry of Industry in Spain and the Vehicle 
Certification Agency in the United Kingdom. In some countries outside the EU – among others Switzerland, Australia and 
Turkey – national type approval is based on prior recognition of the EC/ECE type approval. We are also in close contact with 
the authorities in these countries in order to coordinate the corresponding actions.  
In addition, there is an intensive exchange of information with the authorities in the 
USA and Canada, where Volks-
wagen’s planned actions in relation to the four-cylinder and the six-cylinder diesel engines will also have to be approved.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
290 Due to considerably stricter NO
x limits in the USA, it is a greater technical challenge to refit the vehicles so that all appli-
cable emissions limits can be met. 
Potential consequences for Volkswagen’s results of operations, financial position and net assets could emerge pri-
marily in the following legal areas: 
1. Criminal and administrative proceedings all over the world (excluding the 
USA/Canada) 
In addition to the approval processes with the responsible registration authorities, criminal investigations/misdemeanour 
proceedings have been opened (for example, by the public prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig, Germany) and/or 
administrative proceedings have been announced in some countries (for example, by the Bundesanstalt für Finanz-
dienstleistungsaufsicht BaFin – the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority). The public prosecutor’s office in 
Braunschweig is investigating the core issue of the criminal investigations. Whether this will result in fines for the 
Company, and if so what their amount might be, is currently subject to estimation risks. According to Volkswagen’s 
estimates so far, the large majority of proceedings have less than a 50% probability of success. Contingent liabilities have 
therefore been disclosed in cases where they can be assessed and for which the chance of success was deemed not 
implausible. 
 
2. Product-related lawsuits worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
In principle, it is possible that customers in the affected markets will file civil lawsuits against Volkswagen AG and other 
Volkswagen Group companies. In addition, it is possible that importers and dealers could assert claims against Volkswagen 
AG and other Volkswagen Group companies, e.g. through recourse claims. As well as individual lawsuits, class action law-
suits are possible in various jurisdictions (albeit not in Germany).  
In this context, various lawsuits are pending against Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies at present. 
Class action proceedings against Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies are pending in various coun-
tries such as Australia, Israel, Italy, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The proceedings in the Netherlands are focused 
on taking evidence only. The other class action proceedings are lawsuits aimed among other things at asserting damages. 
The amount of these damages cannot yet be quantified due to the early stage of the proceedings. In South Korea various 
mass proceedings are pending (individual lawsuits in which several hundred litigants have aggregated). These lawsuits are 
filed to assert damages and to rescind the purchase contract including repayment of the purchase price. Volkswagen does 
not estimate the litigants’ prospect of success to be more than 50% in any of the aforementioned proceedings aimed at 
asserting damages. Contingent liabilities have therefore been disclosed in those cases where that can be assessed and for 
which the chance of success was deemed not implausible. 
Furthermore, individual lawsuits and similar proceedings are pending against Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen 
Group companies in numerous countries. In Germany and Austria, individual lawsuits in the two-digit range are pending, 
most of which are aimed at asserting damages or rescinding the purchase contract. According to Volkswagen’s estimates so 
far, the litigants’ prospect of success is below 50% in the vast majority of the individual lawsuits. Contingent liabilities have 
therefore been disclosed for those lawsuits that can be assessed and for which the chance of success was deemed not 
implausible. 
It is too early to estimate how many customers will take advantage of the option to file lawsuits in the future, beyond the 
existing lawsuits, or what their prospects of success will be. On the one hand, the final results of the external investigation 
by Jones Day are not yet known. On the other hand, the public prosecutors’ investigations are also still ongoing.  
Volkswagen is working intensively to finalize the remedial actions described above. For the 2 l engines, implement-
ation already started in the fourth week of January 2016.  
Volkswagen is pursuing the clear aim of not adversely affecting engine performance, fuel consumption and CO
2 
emissions in implementing the planned measures. 
 
3. Lawsuits filed by investors worldwide (excluding the USA/Canada) 
Investors from Germany and abroad have announced that they are examining the possibility of pursuing claims for 
damages against Volkswagen AG due to the movements in Volkswagen AG’s share price following publication of the EPA’s  
 
  ",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
291  “Notices of Violation”. Volkswagen AG had already been served with lawsuits that in particular claim damages due to alleged 
misconduct in capital market communications. In some cases, applications were simultaneously made to instigate 
proceedings in accordance with the Kapitalanleger-Musterverfahrensgesetz (Capital Markets Model Case Act). 
Volkswagen is of the opinion that it duly complied with its capital market obligations. Therefore, no provisions have been 
recognized. Furthermore, contingent liabilities were disclosed for a portion of the submitted claims. The majority of the 
claims either could not be assessed at the time or the chance of success was deemed unlikely. 
 
4. Proceedings in the USA/Canada 
Following the publication of the 
EPA’s notices of violation, Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies have 
been the subject of intense scrutiny, ongoing investigations (civil and criminal) and civil litigation. Volkswagen AG and 
other Volkswagen Group companies have received subpoenas and inquiries from state attorneys general and other govern-
mental authorities and are responding to such investigations and inquiries.  
In addition, Volkswagen AG and other Volkswagen Group companies in the 
USA/Canada are facing litigation on a 
number of different fronts relating to the matters described in the 
EPA’s “Notices of Violation”.  
On January 4, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (
DOJ), Civil Division, on behalf of the  EPA, initiated a civil penalty 
lawsuit against Volkswagen AG, 
AUDI AG and certain other Volkswagen Group companies. The action seeks statutory penal-
ties under the US Clean Air Act, as well as certain injunctive relief. 
On January 12, 2016, it was announced that 
CARB intends to seek civil fines for alleged violations of the California 
Health & Safety Code and various 
CARB regulations. 
The 
DOJ has also opened a criminal investigation. This focuses on allegations that various federal law criminal offenses 
were committed. 
A large number of putative class action lawsuits by affected customers and dealers have been filed in US federal courts 
and consolidated for pretrial coordination purposes in a federal court multidistrict litigation proceeding in the State of 
California. The claims primarily relate to compensation for material damage. The 
DOJ civil penalty lawsuit referenced above 
has also been consolidated for pretrial coordination purposes in this California multidistrict litigation proceeding. 
Additionally, in the 
USA, some putative class actions have been filed; some individual customers’ lawsuits have been 
filed; and some state or municipal claims have been filed in state courts. The attorneys general of four US states (West Vir-
ginia, Texas, New Mexico and New Jersey) have commenced litigation in state courts and allege that Volkswagen Group of 
America inappropriately advertised clean diesels and that customers were misled into purchasing Volkswagen diesel 
vehicles as a result. The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also made similar accusations against the 
Volkswagen Group of America in its lawsuit from March 29, 2016. 
In addition to lawsuits described above, for which provisions have been recognized, a number of lawsuits for damages 
have been filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of Volkswagen AG American Depository Receipts, alleging a 
suffered drop in price purportedly resulting from the matters described in the 
EPA’s “Notices of Violation”. 
These lawsuits have also been consolidated in the federal multidistrict litigation proceeding in the State of California 
described above. Volkswagen is of the opinion that it duly complied with its capital market obligations. Therefore, no 
provisions have been recognized. In addition, contingent liabilities have not been disclosed as they currently cannot be 
measured. 
 
5. Risk assessment regarding the diesel issue 
To protect against the currently known legal risks, including suitable expenses for defense and legal advice related to the 
diesel issue, existing information and assessments at the time indicated the need to generate provisions in the amount of 
€7.0 billion. A sum amounting to €1 billion has also been reported for contingent liabilities, insofar as these can be 
adequately measured at this stage. The provisions recognized, the contingent liabilities disclosed and the other latent legal 
risks are partially subject to substantial estimation risks given the complexity of the individual factors, the ongoing 
regulatory approval process with the authorities and the fact that the independent and exhaustive investigations have not 
yet been completed. In addition, negotiations are currently being conducted with the authorities in the USA concerning 
possible investments in environmental projects and e-mobility. The investments are expected to amount to approximately 
€1.8 billion. Their content and timing have yet to be defined.

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
292 Additional important legal cases 
ARFB Anlegerschutz UG (haftungsbeschränkt), Berlin, brought an action against Porsche Automobil Holding SE, Stuttgart, 
Germany, and Volkswagen AG for claims for damages allegedly assigned to it in the amount of approximately €2.26 billion. 
The plaintiff asserts that these claims are based on alleged breaches by the defendants of legislation to protect the capital 
markets in connection with Porsche’s acquisition of Volkswagen shares in 2008. With its April 2016 ruling, the district 
court of Hannover submitted numerous goals for discovery to the higher regional court in Celle in an attempt to prompt a 
model case decision. In all other cases, the claims were thrown out for being inadmissible. In various cases since 2010, 
investors initiated conciliation proceedings for other alleged damages – including claims against Volkswagen AG – that 
amounted to approximately €4.6 billion in total and also related to transactions at that time. In each case, Volkswagen 
rejected the claims asserted and refused to participate in any conciliation proceedings. 
In 2011, the European Commission opened antitrust proceedings against European truck manufacturers including 
MAN and Scania. In November 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objections to  MAN, Scania and 
the other truck manufacturers concerned, in which it informed the truck manufacturers of the objections raised against 
them and gave them the right to comment extensively on the objections raised and to exercise other rights of defense 
before any decision is reached. Given the fact that the issues are still being clarified, it is too early to judge whether the 
European Commission’s investigation will result in financial liabilities for 
MAN and Scania and, if so, to assess their 
amount. As a consequence, neither 
MAN nor Scania has recognized provisions or disclosed contingent liabilities. 
The Annual General Meeting of 
MAN SE approved the conclusion of a control and profit and loss transfer agreement 
between 
MAN SE and Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH (formerly Truck & Bus GmbH), a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, in 
June 2013. In July 2013, award proceedings were instituted to review the appropriateness of the cash settlement set out in 
the agreement in accordance with section 305 of the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act) and the cash 
compensation in accordance with section 304 of the AktG. It is not uncommon for noncontrolling interest shareholders to 
institute such proceedings. In July 2015, the Munich Regional Court ruled in the first instance that the amount of the cash 
settlement payable to the noncontrolling interest shareholders of 
MAN should be increased from €80.89 to €90.29; at the 
same time, the amount of the cash compensation was confirmed. Both applicants and Volkswagen Truck & Bus GmbH 
have appealed to the Higher Regional Court in Munich. Volkswagen continues to maintain that the results of the valuation 
are correct. The appropriateness of the valuation was confirmed by the audit firms engaged by the parties and by the court-
appointed auditor of the agreement. The assessment of liability for put options and compensation rights granted to 
noncontrolling interest shareholders was adjusted in turn. 
In line with 
IAS 37.92, no further statements have been made concerning estimates of financial impact or about 
uncertainty regarding the amount or maturity of provisions and contingent liabilities, particularly in relation to the diesel 
issue and the European Commission’s investigation. This is so as to not compromise the results of the proceedings or the 
interests of the Company.

295  42. Events after the balance sheet date 
The final approvals for the sale of LeasePlan to an international consortium of investors were issued by the competent 
authorities in January 2016. Legal transfer of the LeasePlan shares to the consortium was completed on March 21, 2016. 
The total value of the transaction was approximately €3.7 billion plus interest in the amount of €31.5 million. In 2016, 
this had a positive effect of €2.2 billion on investing activities and net liquidity and, taking into account the disposal of 
equity-accounted investment in 
GMH, resulted in a low three-digit million euro range for the Volkswagen Group, which is 
reported in the financial result. On completion of the transaction, the existing credit line of €1.3 billion provided by the 
Volkswagen Group was cancelled. 
43. Related party disclosures in accordance with IAS 24 
Related parties as defined by  IAS 24 are natural persons and entities that Volkswagen AG has the ability to control or on 
which it can exercise significant influence, or natural persons and entities that have the ability to control or exercise 
significant influence on Volkswagen AG, or that are influenced by another related party of Volkswagen AG. 
Porsche SE reached an agreement with Suzuki Motor Corporation at the end of September 2015 to acquire 1.5% of 
Volkswagen AG’s ordinary shares via an off-market transaction. At 52.2%, Porsche SE held the majority of the voting rights 
in Volkswagen AG as of the reporting date. The creation of rights of appointment for the State of Lower Saxony was resolved 
at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on December 3, 2009. As a result, Porsche SE cannot appoint the 
majority of the members of Volkswagen AG’s Supervisory Board for as long as the State of Lower Saxony holds at least 15% 
of Volkswagen AG’s ordinary shares. However, Porsche SE has the power to participate in the operating policy decisions of 
the Volkswagen Group and is therefore classified as a related party as defined by 
IAS 24.  
The contribution of Porsche SE’s holding company operating business to Volkswagen AG on August 1, 2012 has the 
following effects on the agreements between Porsche SE, Volkswagen AG and companies of the Porsche Holding Stuttgart 
Group that existed prior to the contribution and were entered into on the basis of the Comprehensive Agreement and its 
related implementation agreements:  
> Volkswagen AG continues to indemnify Porsche  SE against certain financial guarantees issued by Porsche  SE to 
creditors of the companies belonging to the Porsche Holding Stuttgart Group up to the amount of its share in the capital 
of Porsche Holding Stuttgart, which amounts to 100% since the contribution as of August 1, 2012. Porsche Holding 
Finance plc, Dublin, Ireland, was contributed to the Volkswagen Group in the course of the transfer of Porsche SE’s 
holding company operating business. Since August 1, 2012, the indemnification therefore includes financial guaran-
tees issued by Porsche SE to creditors of Porsche Holding Finance plc in relation to interest payments on and the repay-
ment of bonds in the aggregate amount of €310 million. As part of the contribution of Porsche 
SE’s holding company 
operating business to Volkswagen AG, Volkswagen AG undertook to assume standard market liability compensation 
effective August 1, 2012 for guarantees issued to external creditors, whereby it is indemnified internally.  
> Volkswagen AG continues to indemnify Porsche SE internally against claims by the Einlagensicherungsfonds (German 
deposit protection fund) after Porsche SE submitted an indemnification agreement required by the Bundesverband 
Deutscher Banken (Association of German Banks) to the Einlagensicherungsfonds in August 2009. Volkswagen AG has 
also undertaken to indemnify the Einlagensicherungsfonds against any losses caused by measures taken by the latter in 
favor of a bank in which Volkswagen AG holds a majority interest. 
  ",,,,,,,,,,
327,"  
 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
296 > Under certain conditions, Porsche SE continues to indemnify Porsche Holding Stuttgart, Porsche AG and their legal 
predecessors against tax liabilities that exceed the obligations recognized in the financial statements of those companies 
relating to periods up to and including July 31, 2009. In return, Volkswagen AG has undertaken to pay to Porsche SE any 
tax benefits or tax refunds of Porsche Holding Stuttgart, Porsche AG and their legal predecessors and subsidiaries for tax 
assessment periods up to July 31, 2009. Based on the results of the external tax audit for the assessment periods 2006 to 
2008 that has now been completed, a compensation obligation running into the low triple-digit millions of euros would 
arise for Volkswagen AG. New information emerging in the future from the external tax audit that commenced at the end 
of 2015 for the 2009 assessment period could result in an increase or decrease in the potential compensation obligation. 
 
Under the terms of the Comprehensive Agreement, Porsche SE and Volkswagen AG had granted each other put and call 
options with regard to the remaining 50.1% interest in Porsche Holding Stuttgart held by Porsche SE until the contri-
bution of its holding company operating business to Volkswagen AG. Both Volkswagen AG (if it had exercised its call option) 
and Porsche SE (if it had exercised its put option) had undertaken to bear the tax burden resulting from the exercise of the 
options and any subsequent activities in relation to the equity investment in Porsche Holding Stuttgart (e.g. from recapture 
taxation on the spin-off in 2007 and/or 2009). If tax benefits had accrued to Volkswagen AG, Porsche Holding Stuttgart, 
Porsche AG, or their respective subsidiaries as a result of recapture taxation on the spin-off in 2007 and/or 2009, the 
purchase price to be paid by Volkswagen AG for the transfer of the outstanding 50.1% equity investment in Porsche Holding 
Stuttgart if the put option had been exercised by Porsche SE would have been increased by the present value of the tax 
benefit. This arrangement was taken over under the terms of the contribution agreement to the effect that Porsche SE has a 
claim against Volkswagen AG for payment in the amount of the present value of the realizable tax benefits from any 
recapture taxation of the spin-off in 2007 as a result of the contribution. It was also agreed under the terms of the con-
tribution that Porsche SE will indemnify Volkswagen AG, Porsche Holding Stuttgart and their subsidiaries against taxes if 
measures taken by or not taken by Porsche SE result in recapture taxation for 2012 at these companies in the course of or 
following implementation of the contribution. In this case, too, Porsche SE is entitled to assert a claim for payment against 
Volkswagen AG in the amount of the present value of the realizable tax benefits that arise at the level of Volkswagen AG or 
one of its subsidiaries as a result of such a transaction. 
Further agreements were entered into and declarations were issued in connection with the contribution of Porsche SE’s 
holding company operating business to Volkswagen AG, in particular: 
> Porsche SE issued various guarantees to Volkswagen AG in the course of the contribution relating to Porsche Holding 
Stuttgart, Porsche AG and its other transferred investees. Among other things, these relate to the proper issuance of and 
full payment for shares and capital contributions, and/or to the ownership of the shares of Porsche Holding Stuttgart 
and Porsche AG. 
> Under the terms of the contribution of its holding company operating business, Porsche SE also issued guarantees to 
Volkswagen AG for other assets transferred and liabilities assumed. In doing so, Porsche SE guarantees that these have 
not been assigned and are, in principle, free from third-party rights up to the date of completion of the contribution.  
> As a general principle, Porsche SE’s liabilities for these guarantees are restricted to the consideration paid by Volks-
wagen AG. 
> Porsche SE indemnifies its contributed subsidiaries, Porsche Holding Stuttgart, Porsche AG and their subsidiaries against 
liabilities to Porsche SE that relate to the period up to and including December 31, 2011 and that exceed the obligations 
recognized in the financial statements of those companies for that period. 
> Porsche SE indemnifies Porsche Holding Stuttgart and Porsche AG against obligations arising from certain legal dis-
putes; this includes the costs of an appropriate legal defense. 
  ",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
297  > Moreover, Porsche SE indemnifies Volkswagen AG, Porsche Holding Stuttgart, Porsche AG and their subsidiaries against 
half of the taxes (other than taxes on income) arising at those companies in conjunction with the contribution that would 
not have been incurred in the event of the exercise of the call option on the shares of Porsche Holding Stuttgart that 
continued to be held by Porsche SE until the contribution. Volkswagen AG therefore indemnifies Porsche SE against half 
of such taxes that it incurs. In addition, Porsche Holding Stuttgart is indemnified against half of the land transfer tax and 
other costs triggered by the merger. 
> Additionally, Porsche SE and Porsche AG agreed to allocate any subsequent  VAT receivables or liabilities from trans-
actions in the period up to December 31, 2009 to the company entitled to the receivable or incurring the liability. 
> A range of information, conduct and cooperation obligations were agreed by Porsche SE and the Volkswagen Group. 
According to a notification dated January 5, 2016, the State of Lower Saxony and Hannoversche Beteiligungsgesellschaft 
mbH, Hanover, held 20.00% of the voting rights of Volkswagen AG on December 31, 2015. As mentioned above, the 
General Meeting of Volkswagen AG on December 3, 2009 also resolved that the State of Lower Saxony may appoint two 
members of the Supervisory Board (right of appointment).  
Members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG are members of supervisory and 
management boards or shareholders of other companies with which Volkswagen AG has relations in the normal course of 
business. All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arm’s length basis.  
The following tables present the amounts of supplies and services transacted, as well as outstanding receivables and

The tables above do not contain the dividend payments of €4,704 million (previous year: €2,997 million) received from the 
joint ventures and associates or the dividends of €719 million (previous year: €599 million) paid to Porsche SE.  
€148 million (previous year: €5 million) of the related party receivables were written down in the fiscal year. 
In addition, the Volkswagen Group has furnished guarantees to external banks on behalf of related parties in the 
amount of €262 million. 
The changes in supplies and services received from and rendered to joint ventures and their majority interests are 
primarily attributable to deliveries to the Chinese joint ventures. 
The supplies and services received from Porsche SE relate mainly to standard market liability compensation for guaran-
tees assumed. The supplies and services rendered to Porsche SE relate mainly to interest income on loans granted. The 
supplies and services received from Board of Management members in the previous year related mainly to shares 
tendered as part of the offer to Scania shareholders. 
The receivables from Porsche SE mainly comprise loan receivables. The obligations to Porsche SE consist mainly of 
term deposits. 
Obligations to joint ventures and their majority interests contain miscellaneous financial obligations under an irrevo-
cable credit commitment in the amount of €1.3 billion to LeasePlan with a term until December 2018. 
As in the previous year, obligations to members of the Supervisory Board amounting to €165 million (previous year: 
€218 million) relate primarily to interest-bearing bank balances of Supervisory Board members that were invested at 
standard market terms and conditions at Volkswagen Group companies. 
Obligations to the Board of Management comprise outstanding balances for bonuses payable to Board of Management 
members in the amount of €36,244,616 (previous year: €53,686,233) and amounts of €39,433,417 (previous year:

By resolution of the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG, 30% of the variable remuneration for fiscal year 2015 for the 
Board of Management members active on the date of the resolution was withheld and its disposal made subject to the 
Company’s future share price performance. The resolution was not required to be reflected in the calculation of short-
term employee benefits under IFRSs because it was only passed after the fiscal year had ended. 
The employee representatives on the Supervisory Board are also entitled to a regular salary as set out in their employ-
ment contracts. This is based on the provisions of the Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (BetrVG – German Works Constitution 
Act) and represents an appropriate remuneration for their functions and activities in the Company. The same also applies 
to the representative of the senior executives on the Supervisory Board.  
The post-employment benefits relate to additions to pension provisions for current members of the Board of Manage-
ment. 
The termination benefit commitments relate to Messrs. Östling, Winterkorn, Klingler and Pötsch. 
Disclosures on the pension provisions for members of the Board of Management and more detailed explanations of 
the remuneration of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board can be found in note 45 and in the remuner-
ation report, which is part of the management report. 
44. German Corporate Governance Code

The non-performance-related remuneration of the Board of Management comprises fixed remuneration and fringe 
benefits. In addition to the basic level of remuneration, the fixed remuneration also includes differing levels of remuner-
ation for appointments assumed at Group companies. In addition, Mr. Diess received €5,000,000 and Mr. Renschler 
received €11,478,000 as compensation for the loss of benefits due to the change of employer. The fringe benefits result 
from the grant of noncash benefits and include in particular the use of operating assets such as company cars and the pay-
ment of insurance premiums. Taxes due on these noncash benefits were mainly borne by Volkswagen AG. The perfor-
mance-related remuneration comprises a business performance bonus, which relates to business performance in the 
reporting period and in the preceding year, and, since 2010, a Long-Term Incentive 
(LTI)  plan, which is based on the 
reporting period and the previous three fiscal years. Members of the Board of Management can also be awarded bonuses 
that reflect their individual performance.  
The performance-related remuneration measured in accordance with German 
GAAP includes the amounts withheld 
from the active Board of Management members whose disposal is subject to the Company’s future share price 
performance. These are reported at their fair value of €4,218,566. The amount withheld led to the creation of 50,703 
virtual preferred shares. 
On December 31, 2015, the pension provisions for members of the Board of Management in accordance with 
IFRSs 
amounted to €86,601,704 (previous year: €138,046,434). Current pensions are index-linked in accordance with the 
index-linking of the highest collectively agreed salary insofar as the application of section 16 of the Gesetz zur Verbes-
serung der betrieblichen Altersversorgung (BetrAVG – German Company Pension Act) does not lead to a larger increase. 
Members of the Board of Management were paid interest-free advances in the amount of €175,000 (previous year: 
€480,000
 ), which will be set off against performance-related remuneration in the following year. 
Former members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependents received €51,306,960 (previous year: 
€22,792,616). This includes the amounts agreed to be paid to Messrs. Östling, Winterkorn, Klingler and Pötsch in connec-
tion with their departure from the Board of Management. Mr. Östling received non-performance-related remuneration of 
€567,885 and performance-related remuneration of €1,612,398 for the period from March 1 to August 31, 2015. Non-
performance-related remuneration of €2,588,241 and performance-related remuneration of €6,691,011 for the period 
from September 26, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was recognized for Mr. Winterkorn. Taking into account the two-year cap 
to be applied, Mr. Klingler received non-performance-related remuneration of €2,435,488 and performance-related 
remuneration of €11,937,939 for the period from September 26, 2015 to December 31, 2017. Mr. Pötsch received non-
performance-related remuneration of €3,015,800 and performance-related remuneration of €12,283,669 for the period 
from October 8, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The amount was granted net of Supervisory Board remuneration received in 
the period up to December 31, 2017. 
Pension provisions in accordance with 
IFRSs for former members of the Board of Management amounted to  
€ 242,675,809 (previous year: €165,668,945). 
The individual remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is explained in 
the remuneration report in the management report (see page 67). A comprehensive assessment of the individual bonus 
components of the 
LT I is also to be found there. ",,,,,,,,,,

 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Auditor’s Report 
302  
On completion of our audit, we issued the following unqualified auditors’ report dated April 22, 2016. This report was originally prepared 
in German. In case of ambiguities the German version takes precedence: 
 
Auditor’s Report 
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by the 
VOLKSWAGEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT , Wolfsburg, comprising 
income statement and statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements, together with the group management report, which is combined with the management 
report of the 
VOLKSWAGEN AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT , Wolfsburg, for the business year from January 1 to December 31, 2015. The 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report in accordance with the 
IFRSs, as adopted by 
the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § (Article) 315a Abs. (paragraph) 1 
HGB (""Handels-
gesetzbuch"": German Commercial Code) are the responsibility of the parent Company's Board of Management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 
HGB and German generally accepted 
standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) 
(
IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net 
assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial 
reporting framework and in the combined management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business 
activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the 
determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the 
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report are examined primarily on a test basis within 
the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in consolidation, the 
determination of the entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates 
made by the Company´s Board of Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and 
the combined management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Our audit has not led to any reservations. 
   Auditor’s  Repor t ",,,,,,,,,,

  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Auditor’s Report 
303  In our opinion based on the findings of our audit the consolidated financial statements comply with the  IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the 
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315a Abs. 1 
HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial 
position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these provisions. The combined management report is consistent with 
the consolidated financial statements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group's position and suitably presents the opportunities 
and risks of future development. 
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the information provided and statements made in section “Key events” of the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and in section “The Emissions Issue” of the combined management report with regard to the 
emission issue, the underlying causes, the involvement of members of the board of management as well as the impact on these financial 
statements.  
Based on the presented first results of the various measures taken to investigate the issue, which underlie these financial statements, 
there is no validation that members of the board of management were aware of the deliberate manipulation of engine management 
software before summer 2015. Nevertheless, should as a result of the ongoing investigation new knowledge be obtained showing that 
members of the board of management were informed earlier, this could eventually have an impact on the annual and consolidated 
financial statements and on the combined management report for the fiscal year 2015 and the comparative figures for 2014.  
The provisions for warranties and legal risks recorded in the financial year 2015 totalling €14.8 billion are based on the presented state 
of knowledge. Due to the large number of the technical solutions necessary and the inevitable uncertainties associated with the current and 
expected litigation it cannot be excluded that a future assessment of the risks may be different.

Matthias Müller (62) has been  CEO of Volkswagen AG  since 
the end of September 2015. He talks about trust, his  
notion of leadership, and about the future of the Group.
 
 
QUESTIONS:  Johannes Winterhagen 
 PHOTOGRAPHY: Hartmut Nägele
Mr. Müller, what does trust mean for you personally? 
Everything is based on trust, as much in our private lives as 
in the world of business. In connection with the Diesel issue 
at Volkswagen 
rules were broken and ethical boundaries 
overstepped. As a 
result, we disappointed many people and 
forfeited trust – 
among customers, investors and employees 
as well as with the 
political community and the public. So our 
goal now is to win back that trust. And I also see that as my 
most important task.
How can you succeed in regaining trust? You can build trust 
by acknowledging your mistake and demonstrating your  
firm resolve to fix things – not just the consequences, but also 
the underlying causes. In our case that includes convincing 
technical solutions for our customers just as much as the re-
lentless clarification of what happened. Looking towards  
the future, it is vital that we learn from mistakes and draw the 
right conclusions, so that nothing like this can ever happen 
again at Volkswagen. 
What specific steps are called for to make sure an error of 
such magnitude does not happen again?
 We must analyze 
all relevant workflows, identify the weak points and eradicate 
them. 
We are going to great lengths to do precisely that.  
And we are also working on our error management culture. 
Mistakes are a fact of life. It must be possible to talk openly 
about problems, at all hierarchy levels. What is crucial, though, 
is that we are willing to learn from that.— 76",,,,,,,,,,
349,"You have emphasized on several occasions that Volkswagen 
will not allow itself to be paralyzed by the crisis. What  
do you mean by that?
 We need to safeguard Volkswagen’s  
future viability in a world facing fundamental change. We 
were extremely successful for many years. For that success to 
continue under changed circumstances we need to realign 
the Group: our structures, our mindset and our actions – in 
other words, what is commonly known as our “corporate  
culture” – as well as in terms of our strategic goals for the 
 
fu
ture. We are making progress in all of these areas. In that 
sense, you could say the crisis has opened doors.
You just raised the subject of culture. What is your notion 
of good leadership?
 First and foremost open communication, 
readiness to accept responsibility, and a bold entrepreneurial 
spirit. We may have been remiss in fostering this 
attitude in 
the past. Of course, in a company of our size, a fundamental 
change in leadership style will not happen overnight. You 
cannot stand at the factory gate with a megaphone in your hand 
and proclaim a new culture. The crucial point is that we as 
the Board of Management live up to the new form of coopera-
tion, day in, day out.  
What does that mean for you personally? Before I make a 
decision, I talk to the employees who are best able to give me 
the facts and information I need – regardless of where they 
stand in the hierarchy. And I listen very carefully, especially 
when opinions differ from my own. 
The brands are to be given greater independence in future. 
How will you nevertheless be able to leverage technical 
synergies in the Group? During my time at Porsche we enjoyed 
a large measure of freedom and achieved very good results. 
This independence and autonomy will do all the brands good. 
We will leverage synergies by bundling key functions in the 
Group Board of Management. That applies, for instance, to 
brand and product strategy or to the major technologies of  the future. We set the framework, and the individual brand 
groups have the greatest possible autonomy for action within 
that framework. That is how we can make the Group more  
ef
ficient, faster and more flexible as well as harnessing its  
immense potential even more effectively in future.
You are also strengthening the regions. So where will 
Wolfsburg actually have a say in future? At headquarters, 
we define the regions where we see particularly good growth 
opportunities and determine which brands will develop these 
openings. But the actual implementation should be decen-
tral
ized, because local markets know customers’ requirements 
best. That, too, is a question of trust.
What are you doing to get Volkswagen back on the road  
to success?
 Obviously, our top priority is solving the emissions 
issue in the best interests of our customers. At the same time, 
we must develop ideas as to where the Group and the individual 
brands are headed in the long term. That is why we are work-
ing hard on a “Strategy 2025”. 
What is special about this new strategy? Overall, “Strategy 
2018” was very successful, which is why we do not have to 
throw everything overboard. The new strategy is about taking 
the next bold step, putting greater emphasis on elements 
such as digitalization, electro-mobility and a proactive ap-
proach to sustainability. These are the issues that deter-
mine the future, so they have to be right at the top of our agenda. 
I feel it is important that the new strategy is not devised by a 
few people sitting in an ivory tower, but is created in an open 
and structured process.  
Can a traditional car maker set trends in digitalization? 
That must be our mission. Our customers expect us to connect 
their vehicles with their digital world. And we do not want  
to leave that to players from outside our industry. Quite the

Electro-mobility is one strategic focus: when will the

vehicles. The upshot of that investment is a range of very  
attractive electric cars and plug-in hybrids. We will be 
launch
ing more than 20 further models by 2020. By the end 
of this decade, a new battery technology that will allow us  
to offer vehicles with a range of 500 kilometers will be avail-
able. But that alone will not be sufficient. At the same time,  
for instance, an extensive charging infrastructure, especially 
on highways, must also be put in place. Our industry advo-
cates that.  Looking to the future, what role will size play for Volkswagen? 
Size in terms of how many vehicles you sell is not an end in  
itself. We prefer to concentrate on value-added growth. We 
want to generate a financial performance that provides us 
with adequate means to make bold, sustainable investments 
in the future. That is the only way we can safeguard lasting 
success in a changing automotive world.
Where will Volkswagen stand in 2025?  I am optimistic we 
will become one of the world’s leading partners for mobility. 
Both in passenger and freight transport, in urban as well as 
long-distance travel. This calls for the development of new in-
termodal transport concepts. That is the only way to improve 
traffic flows and reduce the environmental impact in metrop

Hordes of market researchers collect data on customers’ wish-

But these are always just snapshots. For a car manufacturer like 
Volkswagen that is active all over the world, it is important  
to know the potential wishes of tomorrow’s customers today – 
and to align research and development activities so that 
these 
wishes can be fulfilled.
Identify long-term developments  
and inspire engineers
Berlin. Wolfgang Müller-Pietralla (54) casts an eye over the 
immaculately turned-out vehicles on display in “
DRIVE.“, the 
new Volkswagen Group Forum which opened in May 2015  
to present ideas on future mobility as well as showcasing the 
latest models. A Ducati catches his attention. Müller-Pietralla 
smiles and moves over to the bike. “Many things change, but 
some always stay the same”, says the Volkswagen Group’s Head  
of Future Research. “There is and always will be an intrinsic 
link between mobility and emotion.”At the same time, Müller-Pietrella is convinced that digitali-
zation is rapidly changing our demands on life and mobility: 
“People are getting used to accessing the entire world via 
their smartphones – and they expect to be able to do that in 
their car just like everywhere else.” So automakers must de-
liver on seamless networked mobility in an ever more complex 
world. In a few years, for example, the driving experience will 
only very occasionally involve searching for a parking space. In-
stead, the car will drive itself to a free space and wait for the 
“come to me” call to the desired location.   
Müller-Pietralla’s team is multi-disciplinary – from IT special-
ists and bionics experts to philosophers – and employs scientific 
methods to track the future. Together with the brands and 
specialist departments, the team sketches future scenarios and 
innovations based on an analysis of future-oriented trends. 
This approach has proved its worth: “Ten years ago we recog-
nized that light would move up people’s list of priorities with the 
advent of new technologies”, Müller-Pietralla recalls. Numerous 
such technologies emerged, right through to adaptive 
head-
lights based on laser technology, which not only illuminate the  
road better but also keep drivers more alert when traveling in 
the dark.
Not even a future researcher can predict the future. “But we
can identify long-term developments and inspire engineers”,
Müller-Pietralla says. “Human intuition is based on empiri cal 
knowledge and vision, and often leads to the best solution for 
the customer.”

Wolfsburg. “Denk:Raum” is what Jennifer Sarah Geffers (38) 
calls a conference room in an office building just outside the 
city center. The name is not the only difference between this 
particular room and many others used by the Group. There  
is plenty of space on the six-meter board that hangs on the front 
wall for several people to brainstorm simultaneously, sharing 
and discussing their thoughts. Colored pens jostle with Lego 
bricks on the shelf. Mere gimmicks? By no means. “This is 
about visualizing good ideas quickly”, explains Geffers; she is 
one half of a management pairing at Group IT and, together 
with a colleague, is responsible for the “Ideation:Hub”, a unit 
set up in October 2015.  
“We are surrounded by ideas”, Geffers says. Some of them 
come from the “Digital:Lab” in Berlin – also recently opened – 
or the “Data:Lab” in Munich, as well as from specialist de-
partments or Group brands. “Another important resource is 
the dialog with start-ups outside the Group, because it pro-
vides impetus for the mobility of the future.” For sales manage-

360,"That is why Geffers created a unique event format called “Digital 
Future Days”. Experts from all over the Group meet up at 
these workshops to discuss one specific issue, such as how to 
introduce customer identification throughout the Group. At 
first glance, that might seem like a technical detail, but in the 
age of digitization it is in fact extremely important: “We need 
unambiguous customer identification – even if the customer 
purchased the vehicle from an independent dealer or bought  
it 
second hand – because that is the only way we can offer them 
digital services tailored to their requirements, such as apps  
or services specifically designed for their particular model”, 
Geffers explains.
This focused search for ideas is one aspect of the work per-
formed by the “Ideation:Hub”. The second, equally important 
aspect is the meticulous evaluation of ideas. On behalf of 
Group IT, Geffers provides follow-up support for “hackathons”; 
these are events where young programmers come together  
to develop new digital solutions and apps. At one particular 
competition, the “Carvatar” app caught her eye: this game 
software encourages drivers to take care of their car, for in-
stance by making sure they do not miss a service check. If, 
like this one, an idea seems innovative and practicable, Geffers 
networks the IT talent with specialists from the Group. In 
fact, Geffers’ mission could be described as making sure that 
no good idea is overlooked. She is absolutely convinced of  
one thing: “Ten years from now, the car will be a vehicle for 
digital services.”Piloted driving lets people enjoy  
the time they spend traveling
Ingolstadt. An enormous poster welcomes visitors to Thomas 
Müller’s office. It is a photo of an Audi RS 7 Sportback
1
 on  
the Hockenheim circuit. The driverless car completed the lap 
in less than two minutes. The 39-year-old belongs to the 
small group of developers who set out in 2010 to make Audi a 
pioneer of highly automated driving; he himself became the 
project manager. What is his motivation? Is he trying to make 
the driver superfluous? Müller vehemently rejects that idea: 
“On the contrary, this is about self-determination! Piloted driving 
should give people greater freedom to organize their time.” The 
first piloted driving model, where the driver can activate a 
traffic jam pilot for stop-and-go traffic, is scheduled to go into 
production soon. On a highway, the pilot can not only accelerate 
and brake at speeds of up to 60 km/h, it can also take over the 
steering.  
Great technological progress has been made in automated 
driving. The central controller, which took up the entire boot 
in the first test vehicles, is now no larger than a laptop. Never-
theless, Müller puts a damper on any expectations of highly  
automated driving in every situation – that is not just a ques-
tion of the technology, the infrastructure and legal regulations, 
it is also because of people: “Drivers have to build faith in a 
self-driving car, so it is quite right to take things step by step.”— 1716",,,,,,,,,,

362," Müller tends to talk more about people than technology. The 
interface between the driver and the piloted car must become 
much more sophisticated than is the case in today’s vehicles. 
For example, drivers must always be given a clear signal whether 
the car is in automated mode or whether to intervene manually. 
They must be able to take back control of the vehicle within ten 
seconds, even if they have just been checking emails. And pilot-
ed driving should feel good as well. “This isn’t so much about 
getting to your destination quickly, but more about enjoying 
the time you spend traveling in comfortable and attractive sur-
roundings”, Müller says. “People can decide for themselves 
whether they want to use their time to work or just sit back and 
enjoy – a bit like a business class flight with a good airline.” 
But with one crucial difference: you can decide at any 
stage dur-
ing the journey to get back into the pilot’s seat.INCREASED SAFETY
90 percent  of all accidents are attributable 
to human error. Many experts believe that  
automated driving can significantly reduce 
the number of accidents.
 
FREEING UP DRIVERS’ TIME
Piloted driving means that drivers decide 
whether they want to take control of  
the vehicle or whether they want to use  
the time they spend in the car for other  
things. Drivers are 100 percent free to 
choose how they organize their time.Benefits of piloted driving  
Audi believes piloted driving offers four  
main benefits to people and society:
IMPROVED FUEL ECONOMY
Highly automated cars are expected to improve fuel 
economy by 
three to five percent compared with  
conventional cars because sensor data and networking  
with road traffic mean that such cars drive more  
smoothly and accelerate and brake less frequently. 
MORE EFFICIENT USE OF ROADS
Autonomous vehicles take up less traffic  
space. That means cities could use up to  
30 percent of the space needed for parking 
more efficiently if vehicles could park auto­
nomously.

Södertälje. Three big screens form a semi-circle in front of the 
cab set up in a darkened lab. Anna Selmarker (46) puts her 
foot on the gas pedal. “Now we’re driving in a virtual world”, 
says the software engineer who is responsible for HMI devel-

opment at commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania. HMI stands 
for “Human Machine Interaction”, the interaction between  
human drivers and their workplace. The driving simulator is 
Selmarker’s most important tool. This is where new display 
and control concepts can be tested at a very early stage in the 
development process. These tests not only involve Scania’s
engineers, but also truck drivers, who thus have the opportu-
nity to test and shape their future workplace. 
Digital networking between the truck and the freight company 
will change the driver’s job quite significantly. More and 
more data about the truck and its handling can be made avail-
able; for example, information on spontaneous changes in 
the route, which results in fewer empty runs and in turn reduces 
the environmental impact. In theory, the possibilities for  
presenting information to the driver are endless, particularly 
given the constant stream of new display technologies. The 
challenge therefore lies in designing a concept that fulfills 
one 
clear priority: “We want to find out how to design dis-
plays so 
that the driver’s attention is never taken off the road.”    Work on new HMI concepts is particularly relevant for auto-
mated truck driving. Scania is one of the participants in a 
project that is researching into “platooning”: this is a system 
whereby trucks drive themselves in tight formation on the 
highway, automatically following a lead truck. The smaller  
inter-vehicle distance reduces aerodynamic drag, similar  
to slipstreaming in cycle racing and therefore also cuts fuel 
consumption. Moreover, automated driving improves safety 
because the risk of a tail-end collision as a result of driver  
inattention is significantly reduced. “This kind of automated 
driving needs completely new information concepts”, 
Selmarker explains. For instance, the driver could be given 
sufficient warning that one of the trucks traveling in front  
is going to 
leave the convoy. The prototype of such a display  
has already been programmed. It even includes a chat function 
which truck drivers in the platoon can use, for example, to  
arrange to meet up for their break at the next rest area. “Such 
interactive ele ments are important for drivers”, Selmarker 
says. “We make sure they can be used safely.”
Four people, four professions, four different tasks in the 
Volkswagen Group. What these four have in common is their

single-occupant electric vehicles. Anyone can order them by 
smartphone right to their doorstep. The most ingenious feature 
of this system is that these microcars, known as “Flywheels”, 
could link together on busy roads to form longer units and could 
even use existing subway tunnels. They disconnect at the sta-
tion nearest the destination and take passengers back home in-
dividually just like a taxi. “That would solve the problem of  
the last mile”, Schwitalla explains. “Many people are loath to 
use public transport because of the journey time and the time 
they have to wait.”

Futuristic? Yes, but that is precisely one aim of the Audi Urban 
Future Initiative. The premium car maker has set out to ac-
tively participate in shaping the city of the future. The global 
trend toward urbanization continues unabated: according  
to UN statistics, 54 percent of people lived in urban areas in 
2014, while 66 percent of the world’s population is expected  
to be urban in 2050. As the global population grows, a further 
2.5 billion people will have been added to the urban population 
by then. But these urban areas will occupy only roughly  
three percent of the Earth’s surface. The population density  
is already enormous today, particularly in Asian cities. In the 
Kwun Tong District of Hong Kong, for example, each square  
kilometer was home to 57,250 people in mid-2014. In contrast, 
Germany’s Federal Statistical Office puts the number of in-
habitants per square kilometer in Berlin at 3,838.The Audi Urban Future Initiative was set up in 2010 to foster in-
novative mobility concepts in various regions of the world. By 
forming development partnerships with cities, Audi is analyzing 
the potential of automotive technology in urban areas. The com-
pany announced the first projects in November 2015: new  
con
cepts for intelligent traffic management and parking space 
management will be tested in Somerville, a city in the Boston 
metropolitan area. In Santa Fe, one of the leading business  
districts in Mexico City well-known for its permanent traffic 
congestion, Audi and its partners are researching the mobility 
behav
ior of commuters. The idea is to develop concepts for adapt-
ing 
mobility behavior based on the findings of such projects.
Max Schwitalla is convinced that the conflict between the car

Dr. Angela Speidel (36) is investigating the answer to that ques-
tion. The chemist is part of the Volkswagen Group Research team 
based in Silicon Valley working on new battery technolo gies 
which have the potential to increase storage capacity and there-
fore extend the vehicle range. The battery researcher collabo-
rates closely with scientists from innovative companies: she is a 
frequent visitor to their labs where she works with them on test ing 
new combinations of materials to determine whether they live  
up to expectations. As she puts it: “For researchers like us, it’s 
also important to find out what doesn’t work.” That is how they dis-
covered that lithium-oxygen batteries, for example, are not an  
option for automobile engineering at present. Speidel is currently 
following a different lead: solid-state batteries. Together with a 
start-up called QuantumScape she is working on a battery that

(33) was already fascinated by the possibilities of automated 
driving while at university in Lodz, Poland. In 2011, he assumed 
responsibility at Volkswagen Group Research for the “V-Charge” 
project: the idea behind V-Charge is that in future drivers can 
leave their electric vehicles at the barrier of an underground 
parking lot. The vehicle then automatically looks for an empty 
parking space with a wireless charging structure and charges 
its battery by induction – just like an electric toothbrush, for 
exam 
ple. Derendarz coordinated the integration of the com-
plete 
vehicle hardware and software under the European collab-
ora
tive project in which several universities and technology 
suppliers were involved. The project established that highly 
automated 
driving in a parking lot with near market-ready 
sensors functions reliably. Derendarz believes “this kind of sys-
tem can go into series production in 2020”. In the meantime,  
a follow-on project investigates whether the technology devel-
oped for parking lots could also be used in 30 km/h restricted

373,"Isenbüttel. Chemical engineer Dr. Miriam Stiefel (35) is 
convinced that “the fuel cell can become a real alternative for 
emission-free long-distance mobility”. That is because fuel 
cells generate electricity from oxygen and hydrogen, and the 
only “waste product” is water. At the Volkswagen Technology 
Center for Electric Traction, Stiefel investigates the core element 
of the powertrain, the fuel cell stack. An individual fuel cell  
is just a few millimeters thick and only produces a small voltage. 
If this technology is to be used to power a vehicle, hundreds of 
these fuel cells must be stacked one on top of the other and con-
nected in series. The main aim of the investigations Stiefel 
carries out on special test beds is to try out new combinations of 
materials. The fuel cells contain an expensive precious metal – 
platinum – which functions as a catalyst to accelerate the 
chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen. The objective 
is 
to reduce the share of platinum so that fuel cell production 
is more cost-effective. “Maybe one day, we will be able to  
dispense 
with platinum entirely, but that is still very much  
uncharted research terrain”, Stiefel says.

More and more people want to be constantly in touch with 
the digital world – and expect their car to have an efficient 
smartphone connection, too. But smartphones and cars do 
not always interact without a hitch. That is why SEAT has 
launched the “SEAT CONNECT” range. All models have in-
built connectivity because they leave the factory complete 
with a smartphone and the preinstalled 
SEAT ConnectApp. 
Thanks to the SEAT Full Link connectivity solution, the 
smartphone can connect with the car via any standard inter-
face and display content directly on the 6.5 inch high-re-
solution color touchscreen. To make sure the driver can con-
centrate fully on the road, the system not only includes a 
hands-free feature but also has a text reading and dictating 
function for handling e-mails and social media accounts.  
In addition, functions such as call lists or contact addresses 
can easily be called up onto the touchscreen.— 3736",,,,,,,,,,
383," Two of the most common causes of traffic accidents involving 
trucks are rear-end collisions and lane departures. The 
Volkswagen Group is therefore working intensively on assis-
tance systems for commercial vehicles designed to help pre vent 
these kinds of accidents. For example, “Emergency Brake  
Assist” (
EBA) has been standard on all MAN truck ranges – 
from light- to heavy-duty models – and all coaches for several 
years now. The system automatically initiates an emergency 
stop in criti cal situations. 
MAN has now developed this system 
further. The new generation of 
EBA combines information 
from radar sensors installed on the front end of the vehicle with 
data from an additional camera integrated in the windshield. 
That means the assistant can detect dangerous situations even 
more quickly and reliably. In case of an emergency stop, the 
EBA system also activates an emergency brake signal in addition 
to the brake lights to prevent secondary accidents. The hazard 
warning light flashes to warn following traffic of the emergency.

because they weigh less. For families, though, they are not 
entirely suitable because the space for passengers and lug-
gage is li mited. Larger electric cars offer that space, but they 
face the challenge of how to deliver on range. The Volkswagen 
Passat GTE

 resolves these conflicting goals by combining an 
electric motor with an internal combustion engine. For shorter 
journeys, the plug-in hybrid can drive up to 50 kilometers on 
an electric 85-kilowatt (115 PS) engine powered by a lithium-ion 
battery – in all-electric mode and with zero 
local emission capa-
bility. For longer journeys, the electric 
motor teams up with  
a 1.4-liter TSI engine to generate a system output of 160 kilo-
watts (218 PS) and achieve a range of over 1,100 kilometers – 
suf ficient to travel non-stop from Berlin to Paris. With room for 
five and storage space for up to 1,613 liters in the wagon version, 
the Passat

“For me, Tabea’s drawing conveys a warm world. The parents 
are sitting under a chandelier enjoying some cake, the chil-
dren are lying in bunk beds and reading; there is even a pool 
on the roof. Inside, the car is like a big home. From the out-
side, the impression is different because mice are nimble, quick 
and small. I love this drawing because in some ways it express es 
ŠKODA’s DNA: a car should be as compact as necessary on the 
outside while the interior should be as generous as pos sible 
with plenty of space for luggage.
Space does not have an intrinsic value, though. You have to  
be very conscious of how you use it, it should benefit people. That 
holds especially true for cars, where space is a particularly 
valuable commodity. I believe there is still potential for improve-
ment. We must look at what children and adults want in terms  
of space. Their wishes must be our yardstick for designing the 
interior of our vehicles. Clever concepts allow us to create 
space without increasing the outer dimensions of a car.”“I would like a car that is very small  
outside and very big inside. Then we 
wouldn’t have to spend ages looking  
for a parking space but there would 
still be lots of room for our luggage

that the environment should be treated with respect.
Brands that want to be successful must also commit to assuming 
responsibility for nature. That is why our work on alternative 
drive systems is so important. New drive concepts also offer great 
opportunities for advances in design. Nonetheless, I do not 
believe new drivetrains will produce a totally different kind of 
vehicle design. People are comfortable with the proportions 
and classic design of a car. We will continue to build cars for 
people, for their dreams and desires, in future, too. Our job  
is to fulfill these aspirations – regardless of the drivetrain

will intensify in future. For me it is all the more important  
to offer people in a car only the information that is actually 
relevant for them at a particular point in time. As an auto-
maker, our starting point must be to ask ourselves what data 
are important for the occupants of a vehicle and what data

407,"This car has a mission. In the words of the man who is re-
sponsible for its success: “Porsche is developing the sports car 
of the future.” Stefan Weckbach (39) has been preparing for 
this mission since the end of 2014. The debut of the “Mission E” 
concept car at the Frankfurt International Motor Show (
IAA)  
in 2015 was only the first stage of a long journey. Series produc-
tion of Porsche’s first all-electric model is to start at the end  
of this decade.
Many details still need to be addressed before the concept  
car becomes a production model. Nevertheless, the “Mission E”  
embodies a promise: even in the era of electro-mobility, a  
Porsche still remains a real Porsche. It looks like a Porsche and 
drives like a Porsche. “We are not making any compromises”, 
says Weckbach.

The Mission",,,,,,,,,,
408," is considerably larger and heavier to ensure a long range. It  
is distributed over the entire underbody between the front 
and rear axles to prevent problems with fast cornering. This 
means that the centre of gravity is very near to the road sur-
face, a typical feature of sports cars. Above all, the battery oper-
ates with 800 volts, more than twice the figure of present- 
day electric vehicles. Higher voltage means that more energy 
flows through the wiring of the vehicle at the same current. 
This is especially important for charging. In only 15 minutes, 
the “Mission E” can charge enough energy for a further 400 
kilo meters. In the owner’s garage, charging convenience is more 
important than charging speed, which is why the batteries of 
the “Mission E” can also be replenished by induction. A magnetic 
coil installed under the vehicle provides the power required, 
which means that the driver no longer needs to deal with a  
cumbersome charging cable.This is why one of the top priorities in the design brief is that 
the “Mission E” must perform like a typical Porsche: it must 
be able to lap the Nürburgring in less than eight minutes. The 
full-feature four-seat sports car offers a highly practical bat-
tery range of at least 500 kilometers without any restrictions. 
This is not only new territory for Porsche but also for electric 
vehicles in general. And yet that is only part of the whole story: 
“We have been working on the electrification of our vehicles 
since 2009”, Weckbach reports. “Porsche launched the Panamera 
S E-Hybrid
1
, its first production plug-in hybrid, in 2013. Since 
then, we have accumulated considerable experience which is now 
proving very useful.”
However, the decision to do without an internal combustion 
engine means approaching many things in an entirely differ-
ent way and breaking new ground. The battery, for example, “With many of today’s electric vehicles, performance 
deteriorates very rapidly following brisk acceleration – 
that is unacceptable for Porsche.”


 Dr. Stefan Weckbach, Vice President Product Line Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) — 6160",,,,,,,,,,
409," Even for an all-electric vehicle, the engine is decisive for the 
car’s performance
. Porsche has opted for permanently excited 
synchronous motors based on the technology of the 
918 Spyder2
 
and the 919 Hybrid and featuring an especially high power den-
sity. Above all, though, the engines have been designed to  
allow high-speed travel over long distances. “With many of to-
day’s electric vehicles, performance deteriorates very rapidly 
following brisk acceleration”, Weckbach explains. “That is unac-
ceptable for Porsche.” Power losses are counteracted by a 
number of features including a sophisticated motor and battery 
cooling system.
Initially, a driver at the steering wheel of the “Mission E” does 
not notice the ingenious technology. The cockpit is strictly  
designed for driving, with no frills or distractions. The driver’s 
eyes focus on five round digital instruments in a free-stand- 
ing cluster that use organic light emitting diodes to generate  
a 3-D effect. Another groundbreaking innovation is the “eye 
tracker”. A camera in the vehicle interior continuously moni-
tors the driver’s line of sight. By looking at a certain instru-
ment and pressing a button on the steering wheel, the driver 
activates the appropriate menu, which can then be operated  
using the steering wheel. This is a car designed for a distrac-
tion-free driving experience. 
Stefan Weckbach and his colleagues are making good pro-
gress with their mission. The first trial electric drive systems 
and high-voltage batteries – known as the subframe – will 
soon be tested on prototypes. The production version is due to 
roll off the assembly line before the end of this decade – not 
just anywhere but at Porsche’s main plant in Zuffenhausen. By 
then, at the latest, the heart of the brand will be electrified.

Volkswagen has taken the next step toward the mobility of the future with  
“
BUDD-e”, the fully-networked long-distance van unveiled at the Consumer  
Electronics Show (
CES) in Las Vegas. The all-electric concept has a range  
of over 500 kilometers as well as a completely new form of interior design.

LOUNGE CONCEPT
 
Opening the sliding door with an intuitive hand 
gesture reveals an interior that is more reminiscent 
of a lounge than a car in the conventional sense. 
The rear features a wraparound bench including two 
tablet PCs that can even be charged inductively;  
the bench is arranged longitudinally in the direction 
of travel. A 34-inch monitor is integrated in the side 
wall.
NEW MODULAR KIT
 
 “ BUDD-e” is the first Volkswagen concept vehicle 
based on the new modular electric toolkit. This  
kit will in future enable an all-electric range of over 
500 kilometers for all vehicle types. The battery 
pack extends flat under the floor between the front 
and rear axles. That creates space and permits 
new, 
unrestricted forms of design. The battery can 
be charged to 80 percent of its capacity in 
just  
30 minutes. Two electric motors, one at each axle, 
power the concept car.

Forgotten your sunglasses? No worries: “BUDD-e” can  
remind its occupants when particular items should  
be remembered – like sunglasses for traveling in fine  
weather. Relevant items are fitted with a transmitter  
(small sticker) in advance, making it possible for the  
car to locate them via the antennas integrated in the  
head liner. “
BUDD-e” also networks passengers with their  
homes – so they can perform tasks such as switching  
lights on or checking the contents of the refrigerator.
GESTURE, TOUCH AND VOICE CONTROL
 
All information and comfort functions are operated  
intuitively by gesture, touch or voice. For example, 
if an occupant says “turn up the heat a bit, please”, 
the system uses voice recognition to locate the pas-
senger giving the command and adjusts the tempera-
ture in that passenger’s zone. “

413," Matt Lewis (23) took the plunge at the end of 2014 when he 
began training as a wood apprentice at Bentley. Wood was 
pretty much an unknown quantity for him until then. So he 
was all the more fascinated by how a piece of wood can be 
transformed into an elegant part for the interior of a luxury 
sedan. “I don’t mind if that means getting my hands dirty 
every now and then”, Matt says with a grin. “Theory isn’t really 
my thing, but I do like to learn with all my senses. I enjoy  
the feel of a work piece, for instance, and the way I can shape 
it with my own hands.” There is no escaping the classroom, 
though, with weekly lessons on basic theory as well as class  
sessions in the “Bentley Wood Shop Studio”. Apart from that, Matt 
practices on the factory’s lathes and milling machines. He  
is 
currently learning how to use a high-tech lathe with sophisti-
cated control technology to craft very complex high-precision 
shapes from pieces of wood.

To be among the best – that was what inspired Giulia Righi (29) 
and 
Diego Guerri (27) to start their careers with Lamborghini 
once they had completed their industrial engineering studies. 
What they learnt was the constantly strive for perfection. Both 
started training as mechatronics technicians at the sports car 
manufacturer at the same time, albeit in different depart-
ments. Giulia worked in Production where she learnt how to 
optimize processes, for example by using virtual analysis. “I 
also had the opportunity to find out more about cross-cutting 
issues such as work organization and stress management”, 
she says. Diego completed his vocational training in the Pre- 
Series Center, working on new concepts for the interior and 
ex terior trim on Lamborghini models. “This involved team-
work with several departments, from Development and Quality 
Assurance through to Production”, Diego explains. Both success-
fully completed their training a little while ago, but their fas-
cination with Lamborghini continues: Giulia is a production 
expert for the new Huracán Spyder1

Series Center as an analyst for the Aventador

418," Xichun Jiao (22) is firmly convinced that “the best teacher is a 
genuine interest in what you are learning”. His fascination with 
electronics began at an early age. Not long before he grad 
uated, 
Volkswagen and one of its chinese joint venture partners 
SAIC, organized a career information day at Xichun’s school. 
He went along and discovered that the company 
offered voca-
tional training to become an electronics technician for auto-
mation technology. He put together the paperwork the same 
day, sent off his application – and was accepted. During his 
training, Xichun worked on data transmission over power lines 
and installed control systems at the company’s plants. “One  
really exciting project was about a factory hall for pressing body 
parts”, Xichun says. Together with his colleagues he de
signed 
and programmed an intelligent control system for the 
lighting 
technology. Xichun has now successfully completed his train-
ing and has stayed on with 
SAIC VOLKSWAGEN .

419," Julien Clement (27) inherited his passion for motorcycles 
from his father and his talent for drawing from his mother. 
This combination inspired the young Frenchman to study  
design at an academy not far from Lille after graduating from 
high school. A fellow student put him in touch with Ducati 
while he was looking for somewhere to complete his six-month 
mandatory internship during the fourth year of his studies. 
That took him to Bologna where he decided to work on a special 
project: Julien was tasked with coming up with the first draft  
of the new Scrambler design. He presented a convincing modern 
interpretation of the iconic dual-purpose bike which made a 
name for itself in the 1970s: Ducati revived the Scrambler in 
2015,
 and Julien is now the Ducati Scrambler Designer. “I’m 
living my dream”, he says. “I was in the right place with the right 
idea at the right time.”
